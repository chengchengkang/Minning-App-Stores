Order ahead by App is Dope!
I have used the order ahead and pick up at six different Starbucks in San Diego and it is the coolest thing ever.  I wonder how many people who have watched me zip in and say my name and get my drink without ordering wonder how I got my superpowers!  So easy to use and pay by card.  Sure, you have to have a card on your phone but who doesn't in 2015.
