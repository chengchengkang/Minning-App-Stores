Great app for the most part
This is a great, easy-to-use app that keeps track of your rewards status and makes it simple to reload your card. The only thing I would like that it lacks is the ability to create a 'Favorites' menu of all the beverages and foods that I've tried and liked. Other than that, it's great!
