With Lollipop it's licking good, love it! I use NEXUS 4 (4.4.2 ART)  ===== Essentially excellent. Now working without any problem also in ART runtime. For non-developers also. Thanks a lot !  I'm loving this app more and more. So clean and effective. Sometimes it's  a problem with paid *looks* and happened I couldn't save ;-) *my masterpiece* ;-) because of lack of Internet (at least it seems like that). And Revel is amazing even as complimentary service.  Cheers!
