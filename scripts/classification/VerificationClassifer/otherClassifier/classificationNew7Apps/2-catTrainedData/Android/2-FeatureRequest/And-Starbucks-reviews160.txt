I Love the Starbucks App!
I Love the Starbucks App! I am so excited that Starbucks now has coconut milk--I can enjoy all my favorite drinks without a tummy ache (dairy and gluten free). In regards to the app I wish that the information updated quicker. I truly enjoy all the Rewards like the Star Dash contests and running Frappucino happy hour throughout the summer would be terrific. It would also be awesome to see some more gluten free goodies in the bakery maybe--French macaroons.  Full Review
