****July update 2015****!!!! *****still the worst! *****why is the twitter app so ugly!!!! I actually like the new profile page for my profile , I wish it wasn't so hard to get to. The rest of the UI is a mess. A great UI - Timeline, swipe over to what's trending, swipe again to see your profile. I hardly use Twitter anymore because of it
