Cannot delete items from "my Choice" Hello,    I like this app, it works great. However I cannot delete items from My Choice. Package tracking number hang around for 30 days or so and then vanish. There is a "trash can" symbol in the app that always you to delete numbers and even confirms that the selected number has been deleted.   However the number remains. Any ideas what is going on?
