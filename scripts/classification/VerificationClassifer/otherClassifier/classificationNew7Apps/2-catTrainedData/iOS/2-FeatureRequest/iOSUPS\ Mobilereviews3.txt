It tracks packages
That's pretty much it. It does what it says it does (and ignoring the fact most people here are reviewing the company instead of the app) as far as the app goes, it does the function that it states well, and that's it.

Could use more features but app works as intended. Could use faster loading times. Push notifications very useful for trekking forgotten packages.
