This is the only game that has gotten worse since release
This game when it first came out was fun and didn't charge any micro transactions(in app purchases) which is what made it so fun. You used to be able to get new blades just by doing fun challenges and such. Then they introduced star fruit... That's when it all started going downhill... Sadly, this used to be amazing and simple game has gone mainstream... Filled with ads, in app purchases, and more bull... Sigh...
