Why did you bring back one of the worst parts?
This app would be great if you stopped adding annoying features! 

- Why did you bring back those annoying "[username] follows" tweets at the top of my timeline when I refresh? I don't want to see random tweets from people I don't follow! If I wanted that, I WOULD BE FOLLOWING THEM. If I refresh my timeline, I just want to see if there are any new tweets from people I actually care about.
(At least I don't see other people favorites anymore, but man, who thought this was a good idea to bring back?)

- When you make a new tweet, your photos show up instead of the keyboard. I most text tweets way more than photo tweets, and so do most other people.
