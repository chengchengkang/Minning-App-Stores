I would like to see some of the blades getting new powers. I was excited to see that the blades are now unique in more ways than sound and appearance. 

You guys are doing great with new ideas. But, what about an option to throw ninja stars instead of slicing with blades?

Here's the gist: Like the blades, the ninja stars would use powers based on their "element" or name. You could throw them and you could also have a background that has targets in the back that can give you extra points. 

Hope to see new updates in the future. Thank you for being a great game all around!
