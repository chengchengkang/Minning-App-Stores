Great app
Does what it's supposed to. Never crashes. I still find it a touch hard to navigate sometimes when I looking for something even though I've used it for a long time. I'm not sure that's it's the app design or me quickly searching near the register. I do wish that when you give a tip, that it confirmed that the tip was received. It gives no indication that it actually worked. For me, I could give the app 5 stars if that was remedied.
