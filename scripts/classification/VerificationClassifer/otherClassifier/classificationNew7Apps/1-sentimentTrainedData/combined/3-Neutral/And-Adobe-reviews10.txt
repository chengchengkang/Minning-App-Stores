Honestly I love this app ..but unfortunately it defeats its purpose if 1) it doesn't save the edited pics to my gallery and 2) it stops working and freezes almost a minute later after using the app . Need to fix that. And that's why I will uninstall this app and will try again later ...hopefully you guys will have these issues fix by then.
