Please Fix
Hey not sure if the developers will get this or not but I use Vine frequently and after this update the app has not worked for me at all, as I open the app my screen gives me the disappointing little frown face and I can't load my stream notifications nor profile or messages. I've deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times restarted my phone and nothing please help.
