Protected Error
This app would have been at least a 4 if the protected account thing wasn't so messed up. Once I want my account unprotected that's what I expect. Except now I can't get out of unprotected mode. It's literately forcing me to have my account still protected. Please fix this. It's really making everyone mad because I KNOW I'm not the only one with this problem. I don't want to feel like I'm forced to have my account protected. Thank you.
