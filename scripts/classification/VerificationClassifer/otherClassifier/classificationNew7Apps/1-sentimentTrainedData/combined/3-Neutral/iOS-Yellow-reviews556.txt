Search results
OK I know the search results needed to be better BUT, I am in Ridgecrest CA, not a very big town. Why can I not get search results for the whole town looking for a restaurant. When we were on the north side of town I only got restaurants on that side of town. Now we are on the souths side and can only get results on the south side. Come on, they can't have but about 30 resturants total.
