Why can't I switch accounts as easy
I'm not sure what happened with this update but I use to be able to go to my Twitter page, pull down and access my other accounts. I can't do that anymore and I can't figure out how to switch back and forth between accounts. This is super frustrating and makes it so much harder for me to be active on my accounts.
