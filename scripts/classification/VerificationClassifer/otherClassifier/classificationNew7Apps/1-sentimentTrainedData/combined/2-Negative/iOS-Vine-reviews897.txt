Suspending my fav Viners
I'm really upset. Vine is getting rid of and or suspending vine accounts that have done nothing wrong. Jesal's edits is my favorite viner and he got suspended for doing nothing! You're going down hill, Vine. And if you don't do something about it you're just gonna keep going down hill till you hit rock bottom.
