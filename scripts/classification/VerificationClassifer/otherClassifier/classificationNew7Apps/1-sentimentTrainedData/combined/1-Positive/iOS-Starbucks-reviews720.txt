Love it.
The app is awesome right now. Ever sense Starbucks totally change and gave the app a new makeover/look that they called simple, there was a few things people missed or wanted back. After they they slowly fixed or added a few things back that people want. Now it's perfect but still simple the only thing I wish it did have though was a price for the items in the menu. It would be nice to be able to look up a price for something before going to the store if needed. Other than that I think the app is great. I love it.
