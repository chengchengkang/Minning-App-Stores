Love the Mobile Order!
The mobile order is the best thing ever. I usually go through the drive thru, which has taken up more than 10 minutes, so having this app is a lifesaver. The ordering is so convenient, I order before I get in the car and since there's a Starbucks on every corner where I live, I just walk up to the counter and it's already made. It's that easy! I usually walk out if the line is too long, but with this new feature, I'll always have my coffee ready.
