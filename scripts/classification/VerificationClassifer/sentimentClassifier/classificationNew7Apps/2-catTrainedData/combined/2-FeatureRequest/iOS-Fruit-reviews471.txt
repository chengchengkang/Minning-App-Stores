No multiplayer and becoming freemium.
All the good parts of the game are being taken out now 
There is no more multiplayer.
Blades and backgrounds cost an exorbitant amount of star fruit (a virtual currency that replaces the old achievement based unlocks).
This game also has ads in a paid version! It's become so monetized that it is no longer fun.
