Works well and is easy to use
For those of you that are not experienced, you will be able to enhance your photos by trying a bunch of different options. There is no WRONG way to change your pics. Just be creative. Your original pic will be there if you don't like what you see after you play with the options. 
I would like to be able to grab the next photo without going back into my library.
