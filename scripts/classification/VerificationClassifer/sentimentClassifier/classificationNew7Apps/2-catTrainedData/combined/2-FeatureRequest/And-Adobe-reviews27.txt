In App Purchases will nickle and dime you. Once you buy/unlock all the features, and if you have a solid BB connection,retty useful. However, the app keeps telling me I have to purchase this or that feature (which I've bought 2 expansion packs for $5 and then $3). Should be free to those of us who paid for Photoshop & Lightroom CC. Also, it crashes a lot (4 times:  2 on my Note 10.2 and 2 on Note 4)...
