Needs area for custom ordering
I order everything through this app now, it makes group ordering a breeze. The ONLY issue is my being unable to customize the order specifically. "Tall double shot, extra Ice in a grande cup." I have to make them put it in a grande cup when I arrive, and these busy baristas don't love having to do that. Otherwise, I tell everyone about this app.
