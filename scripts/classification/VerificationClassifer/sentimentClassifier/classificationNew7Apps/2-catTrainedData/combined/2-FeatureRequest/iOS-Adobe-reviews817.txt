Great variety of adjustments!
I really enjoy that you can actually manipulate your image as you please, taking in account the basic adjustments that most apps don't have. What I mean is that sometimes you don't want to use filters, just touch up certain technical aspects from the image such as highlights or shadows. And it also allows you to use predetermined filters, my only objection is that it doesn't allows changes to the intensity of them, meaning you cant manipulate the opacity of the filters. But for a quick enhancing app, this works excellent!
