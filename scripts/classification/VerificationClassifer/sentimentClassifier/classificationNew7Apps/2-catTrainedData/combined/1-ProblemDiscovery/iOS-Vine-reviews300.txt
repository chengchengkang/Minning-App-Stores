Great..but just one problem!
I love vine I use it everyday, but ever since the new update I haven't been able to to a couple of stuff, for example. I can't undo revines (I don't know if anyone else has this problem). Another thing is the search engine, it's a little "off" if you may. Most of my family uses vine but I can't find them because it limits the search to just a few people. Other than that this is an amazing app, fix those problems and It'll get five ðŸŒŸ's for sure!
