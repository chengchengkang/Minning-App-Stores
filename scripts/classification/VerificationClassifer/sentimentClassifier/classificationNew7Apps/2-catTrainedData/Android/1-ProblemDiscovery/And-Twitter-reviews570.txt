Can't tweet anything The buttons for tweeting, posting a pic, or place are so tiny I can't even hit them!!! Every time I try, it hits the "tweet" behind it!! Please fix this, it bugs the heck out of me since I can't write anything, I have to use the computer, and that's not convenient when I'm in a hurry or not at home. PLEASE FIX THIS, new update to change it back to the way it was, makes it easier.
