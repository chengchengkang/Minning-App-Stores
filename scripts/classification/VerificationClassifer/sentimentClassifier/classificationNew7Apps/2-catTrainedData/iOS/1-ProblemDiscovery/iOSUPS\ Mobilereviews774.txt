JUNK !!!!
First you download this thing , you go to track a package and you get the error message " CANNOT CONNECT TO SERVER " then you cannot open an account from the APP. You have to go online to open an account , and then, the APP tells you , you have an unknown E-MAIL ADDRESS AND / OR UNKNOWN USER . What good is it when you have to leave the APP and use a home computer ? All they other APPS , you can open an account and that's it !!!!! THIS APP. IS TRASH !!! I expected ALOT MORE FROM UPS !!!!
