The processor!
Ok so it is an ok editor for a freebie for sure! Can't complain. I can however make a few suggestions. I am a sort of editor junkie to say the least, Bahaha! But things like the doodle freely type option almost every joe blow app has this is safely missing. Also some sort of blanketing system I can not for the life of me remember the name but where all certain shades can be turned off or even the erase mechanism along with the doodler option would be awesome I use that and make the pic b&w and erase back to normal the highlights of my choosing so fun and awesome... Should look onto it! Again suggestions. Beside that it does do a lot if wishes are to not have to do detailed accents which I embrace and so enjoy! Lol. :)
