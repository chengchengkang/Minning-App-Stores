review from an editor
I am part of a community of people who edit videos for bands, youtubers, actors, etc. We work really hard on what we put out and I don't think vine understands that. A lot of accounts are being deleted because we don't have videos from our direct camera on our pages. This is just dumb, and I really don't want to go everyday worrying about my account being deleted. Also, I don't like how you have to have a hashtag in the caption for the edit to show up when people search it. that's how a lot of small accounts get their videos out there. Also, bigger accounts have contests and to enter you can put a hashtag on an older video and it will show up. Now there is no way to do it because you can't edit a caption. Please think about changing the hashtag situation! One more thing, I can safely say that a strong portion of this app's users own editing accounts and maybe it would be a good idea to add a channel for it!
