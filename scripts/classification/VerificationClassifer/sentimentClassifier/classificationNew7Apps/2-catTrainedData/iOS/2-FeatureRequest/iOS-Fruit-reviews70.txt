UPDATE!!!!
Back when this game was good it did not require in app purchases and keep certain blades from players who BOUGHT the game. The in game currency also changed making star fruit the only way to unlock blades. It was soooooo much better when doing achievements actually unlocked blades. They have ruined fruit ninja and made it into a pay to have fun game.
