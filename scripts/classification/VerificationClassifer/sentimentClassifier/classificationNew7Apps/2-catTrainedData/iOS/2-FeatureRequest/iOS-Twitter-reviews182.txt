DISCOVER & FOLLOW ON NOTIF
I want the discover app back! Its the only way i know whats trending. My tl is so full its easier to see main tweets that way as well! Please put it back! Also when im in my notifications i dont get the correct 'just followed you' things. Itll light up but then it wont show. Of course i know to go to followers to see but its easier to see quickly that way please fix ugh
