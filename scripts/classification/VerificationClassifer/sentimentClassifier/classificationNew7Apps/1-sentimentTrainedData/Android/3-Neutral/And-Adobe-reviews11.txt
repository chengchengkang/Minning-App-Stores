How to downdate it? I LIKE Free Adobe Photoshop. Thnx for the hardwork of the team. Updated it half hour ago. Was fine & smooth before the limited free edit options. But now its like many ants walk on the picts. The result is too horrible. How to downdate/downgrade, down whatever 'coz of my limited english? Please..
