Hate it Every time I put my address in it told me it didn't exist. I think I know my own address. I finally got it working. So now I'm trying to to get the my choice working. I'm having so many problems with it. They won't let me synch my phone with it so I could get the activation code or give me the quiz. But it will send me a letter with it. That should come in 2-5 business days. By then I will have this app deleted. Its a waste of space. But so are the people working for the ups.
