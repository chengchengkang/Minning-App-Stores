Okay Had this game for ages now and always loved it as a time filler when I was waiting for something. Completely unimpressed that it has moved so strongly to in-app purchases. It's still fun when bored but the clear money grab and constant (forced) advertising of their other products is pushing the game very close to deinstallation.
