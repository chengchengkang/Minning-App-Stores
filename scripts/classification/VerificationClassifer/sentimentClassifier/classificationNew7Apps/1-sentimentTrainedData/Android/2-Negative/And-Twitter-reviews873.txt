Really? I installed this just to see what the "official" app was like. If you guys (dev's) can't contrive a better user experience than this by yourselves, the least you could do is mimic the competition, i.e., Plume, Uber, TweetCaster, etc. This "effort" seems to be the result of an "It's free, so take it or leave it" attitude. Stop trying to monetize via ads that just tick people off, and write a decent app to sell. Leave this garbage to the freeloaders. Obviously no capitalist principles at work, here.
