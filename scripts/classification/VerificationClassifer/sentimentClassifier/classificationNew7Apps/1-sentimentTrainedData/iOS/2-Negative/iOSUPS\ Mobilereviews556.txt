Hopeless
This could be a great app if it only worked as intended. It does not matter when or how many times you enter a request to change the delivery option to hold a package at a nearby UPS facility because your request will be ignored either by this App, UPS' system, or its personnel, so that the package gets put on the truck out for delivery anyway. Hopeless, given how many times this has happened to me.
