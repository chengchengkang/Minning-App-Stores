Update is the WORST
Used to love this app. But now it always starts by asking me if I want to report my crashes and worst of all, you used to be able to look up a business and get the phone number (after all, I am on a PHONE). But half the searches now provide NO phone number, the sort of thing you should be able to get FIRST on a yellow pages app and certainly EVERY time with some digging. But it just isn't so anymore.
