A lot of the other reviewers are complaining
Um it seems that the current update was the worst so far. Come on the other reviewers noticed already . They are so right. $2 for a blade (chainsaw) totally seems like a scam. I actually care about that. I also play a lot of other games . In app purchases are just a sucker grab. I know first hand about this . There also is the fact that the new blade was a " challenge" that was presented to HalfBrick. Just be nice and respond to the reviews. A lot of us do not have money. Stop expecting people to buy non existent products. We the reviewers are getting annoyed with non response . Advertising is a mistake to. Money is used for a lot of things . I am on both sides though mostly on the reviewers side. Let us have our way and not force us to wast money. Games are fun but this is not fun. Give ack all that was wrongly taken from the hammers. Respect our rights and you will be forgiven. In this world that money is spent on music or other stuff. Parents are cautious of this. That means not allowing kids to spend money . Also stuff that isn't really there isn't trustworthy. I spent too much money in other better games.
