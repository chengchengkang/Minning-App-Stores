Facebook Posting Is Bad
As others have noted, FB login is great BUT I don't want you posting anything and every time I launch the app, sign on fails because I won't allow it. 

Also, I want the current day at the top of the feed. I don't want to scroll through the past to get to the present.

But overall a nice design of the app. Just fix the FB thing.
