Photoshop Express for iPad
I've seen some pretty scathing reviews about this program. I don't what the problem is. I use strictly to improve a lot of my iPhone shots for posting on social media. It's quick and serves my purpose. I have several cameras: DSLR's and mirrored. I use a full version of Photoshop on my PC and Mac. Some of the choices are quite similar. I think for the price you can't beat it. I come from the film era. 50 years of it. The digital age is pretty sweet.
