Really Great App Love the advanced features and the ability to manually adjust almost every aspect of the picture, the pro version really is the best serious app on the market. Downside is that sometimes after a few minutes it crashes and loses all the editing on that particular photo.  Also, you must re-download edited pic for Dropbox photoshare and some other apps because it does not save to Gallery automatically. The 'blemish' removal or 'blur' is not the best unless the original photo is near sided.
