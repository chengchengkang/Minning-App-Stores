Hi
I like this app very much
It gives me location, menu, what member I am with the rewards I get and let's me load my card digitally. The only problem I had is I had a card loaded. I was given a second card. When I loaded my second card it asked me if the card I am loading is a secondary card. I clicked yes. When I went to check, the card I loaded was put as my balance and I had no money instead of my main card having money.
