Best Photo Editor except Revel This is definitely, the best photo editor in android and ios. However, the constant reminders to review it after every new update installed even though you have already reviewed 8000 times is boring. And the tab width tries to get you to join up with adobe revel, which i will never ever use, because i have icloud is also completely superfluous and also pretty much bothersome
