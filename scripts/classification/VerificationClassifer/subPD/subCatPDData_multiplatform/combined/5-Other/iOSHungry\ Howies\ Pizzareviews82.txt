Not bad but needs work for iPod Touch 4g First issue: If a finger swipe is to side scroll at top menu to select pizza, salad, side, etc., it didn't work for me. This cost it 1 star.
Second issue: If I'm picking up the pizza (almost always), I want the option to pay at pickup available when I submit my order. This cost it 2 stars and forced me to use my PC to order online.
Next time we order pizza, I'll check to see if it's updated & above issues are fixed.
