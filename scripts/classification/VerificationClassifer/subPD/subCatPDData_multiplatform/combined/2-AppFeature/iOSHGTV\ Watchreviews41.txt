Air Play and commercials: fix the problem! While using the app there aren't too many complaints from me (except there are too many commercials).  

However, just as others have stated, those commercials- especially the first block after the first segment of a show - causes an error when you stream via Air Play.  

I miss the days where the commercials would play BEFORE the show.  C'mon Bottlerocket...fix the app!

Two stars until that bug is fixed.
