Video over Cellular Seriously, why can't I watch this app on cellular. 
I get a message stating that I must turn on my "use cellular" and I have and I still can't watch unless I am connected to wi-fi, which I don't always have.  Why can't the powers that be, just turn on tv without all of these stupid apps?
