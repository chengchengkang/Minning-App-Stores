Pretty decent with just a few shortcomings I really like this app but there are just two things that I wish worked better:

1. Synchronization - I have this app installed on two devices and it doesn't synchronize the days I've tracked my movements ... to a certain degree. The data is synchronized but the "progress" icons in the calendar are not.
2. It doesn't track everything ... Specifically, it doesn't track Ab Ripper X. I'd like to record the number of reps done on each exercise. Similarly for Yoga X and Kempo Karate. I'd like to at least have check marks that I've done (or not) some particular movement.

Other than that, I do love it. It's far more convenient than the spreadsheet or printed worksheets and the ability to take pictures and store measurements all in one app is awesome. I find it quite motivational. Also, by sharing my tracked movements on Twitter or Facebook steps up the accountability factor!
