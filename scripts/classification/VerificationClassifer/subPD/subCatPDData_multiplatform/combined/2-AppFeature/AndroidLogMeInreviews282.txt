Let's face it, this app is awesome But it lacks the file browser options that are on the ios. I had an iphom for about 4 years. My only let down is this app NOT having the same functions as the ios app. I basically purchased this app twice for no apparent reason. I thought it would have the same capabilities that I used on a daily basis with my Iphone. Add the file browser and I will rate 5 stars!
