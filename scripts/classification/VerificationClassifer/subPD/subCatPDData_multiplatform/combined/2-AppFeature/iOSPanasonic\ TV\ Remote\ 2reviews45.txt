Slightly Improved over Version 1.40 When I reviewed the previous version my main complaint was that I'd like to use the keyboard to type on the screen, for example on Netflix.  This APP doesn't do that.  As another reviewer pointed out, it will turn the TV off, but not on.  Once again it's deleted from my iPad.
