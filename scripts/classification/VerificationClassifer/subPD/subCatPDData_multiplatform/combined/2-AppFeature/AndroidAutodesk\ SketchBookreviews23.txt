It's ok but not ment to be mobile I bought the drawing program for my laptop.It felt in love with it than using free version.when it comes to the paid version of this mobile.I find it very hard draw on my phone&keep freeze cut on my drawing where couldn't see undo buttons.The buttons are too small finger to bearly press on&color.It's hard move picture around when trying hold the screen to end up leave smushes by accident.If I save the file then try upload it to try fix it, it color over my outlines&background.Idk want to still keep the app
