Commercial airplay problem error needs to be fixed!! Every time we are watching a show, it goes to commercial, then when time to start back show it says error during airplay and then we have to restart the show and drag to the spot we were watching and then get to watch the commercials all over again.  This happens at each and every commercial spot during the show.  This is highly annoying to where we just stop watching.
