Invalid email format? I hoped that after one year of not using this app that you would have fixed this issue. When the app first came out everything worked perfectly but then started saying Invalid email format when submitting my order. WTF? That was a year ago and the issue has not been addressed. I used to order food at least once a week. Now I order from Hungry Howie's maybe twice a year. Want my return patronage, fix this issue! My email account works fine if I order from my laptop.
