What? I downloaded the app and then-POOF! It disappeared! I went to the search iPod selection, and typed in stardoll access and nothin came up, and I went to the app store, to see if I could re download it, and it said installed. I had gotten it before, except chat didn't work!!! And when I went to check it, and tried to exit out of it, it wouldn't let me! Ughhhhh!
