Crashing One of my biggest fears in the game is when I go to buy an item. This is because about one in three times I tap the buy button, it crashes. The main reason this makes me mad is because when I get back on the game, the item is bought and a thing that sounds good is that it doesn't take away any of my gold. But it doesn't give me the extra attack points, defence points, etc. and I can't rebuy the item. This has happened to me quite a few times now, and I'm just mad that my charactor can't reach his full potential. Please try to fix this crashing problem soon!
