Dishonest business practices I use this to help my mom with her computer, maybe once a month. Yet I still purchased the Ignition app for $30 because I believed it would be a one time purchase. This is far more than I've paid for any other app. Now they are rendering the app useless and forcing an overpriced subscription model on all their users. This is unacceptable, and I will find an alternative.
