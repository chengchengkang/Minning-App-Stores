Bait and switchy To give people 7 days to switch or pay up is pretty bad, especially with little regard for those that bought this under different pretense.  I bought this a couple years ago and got decent use from it, but it's still probably the most single expensive app I purchased it.  It'd be one thing not to update it, and another to send just 7 day notice to pay more on subscription basis or have it disabled.
