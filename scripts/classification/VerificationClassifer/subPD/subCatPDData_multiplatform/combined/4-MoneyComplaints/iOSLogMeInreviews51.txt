Paid money for this, now need subscription? I bought this app years ago, and it wasn't cheap. Then they made it free, but now they want to charge a $49 a year subscription to use it. I won't be able to use it starting October 20th unless I pay. That's BS and I'm not sure that's legal. I didn't lease this app, I bought it. A purchase shouldn't expire. They shouldn't be able to renegotiate the terms of the purchase years after I already bought it.
