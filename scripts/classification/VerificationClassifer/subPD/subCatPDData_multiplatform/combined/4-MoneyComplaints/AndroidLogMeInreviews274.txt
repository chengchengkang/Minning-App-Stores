Free only because you pay to connect! Not worth it! No warning then BAM my $30 app is now useless. I purchased this app last year and it worked well until they changed the payment model to a subscription based service without warning. The app may now be free but the ability to connect to computers is now subscription based. They say they are offering discounts on the subscription if you purchased ignition previously but the whole point was that I PAID IN ALREADY. FAIL.
