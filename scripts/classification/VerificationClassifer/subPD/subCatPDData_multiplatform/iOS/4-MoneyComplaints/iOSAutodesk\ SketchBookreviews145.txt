Why did I have to re-purchase? Just like everyone said.  Why did I have to re purchase an app I've already purchased with the majority of functions the old one had which I still have on my iPad? Dont get me wrong the new one matches the same options as the desktop version which is nice touch when you pay the $3.99 for the pro version.  Also, where's the function to upload my art works to my Dropbox account and to my icloud which has my drawings from the old version. Why could they have just update their app like any other mobile app developer.  I am really disappointed that I had spent more money for the same software I've already have. I'll stick with my Procreate app, at least they  they don't make you purchase over again when new functions are added.
