Terrible execution Bought this app for use with Intuos Creative Stylus 2. Terrible offset (not as bad as for lefties, but still unusable). What's the point of having a precision stylus when you have a huge offset?!

Tested the stylus in other ICS2 compatible apps- they all performed much better. 

And now I need to go back up my old Sketchbook pro to my computer since it's no longer in the App Store. 

One of my favorite apps took a big nosedive with this release.
