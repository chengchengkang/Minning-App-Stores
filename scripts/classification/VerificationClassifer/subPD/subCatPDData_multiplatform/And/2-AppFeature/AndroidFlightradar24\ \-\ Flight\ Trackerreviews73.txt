Not on par with iOS version Decent app, but when I've compared it to the iOS version, the Android app is lacking. When tracking flights on iOS, altitude and other relevant data is updated by the second so you always know the altitude, etc, at any given time. By contrast, the Android version does not update those values rarely at all... usually only every 10 seconds, sometimes not even then (in that case, I'd have to stop tracking the flight and research for it and select it to see the updated data). Even when it does update on its own, it's always a rounded number, such as 8,000 instead of, say 7,532 on the iOS.  I was tracking a flight that a relative was on which was, on the Android version, apparently cruising at a constant 10,000 feet, but when I looked at the iOS device tracking the flight, it was actually at 8,325 and descending. Both my devices are wifi only versions, fully updated and connected to the same network (Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and iPad Air 2). This needs to be fixed. Developers need to support the Android version with the same amount of features, updates, and functionality as the iOS version.
