U Need to update! The software application seems to Be unstable on the last Android update. My brother has the same issue I believe he left a comment, problems are occurring within the layers you spend half an hour coloring in next you know all the input is gone left with a clear layer. That's just ridiculous my brother and I use this on our desktops and laptop because we are freelance artist, and now this application became a nightmare. We paid for this app we demand a fix.
