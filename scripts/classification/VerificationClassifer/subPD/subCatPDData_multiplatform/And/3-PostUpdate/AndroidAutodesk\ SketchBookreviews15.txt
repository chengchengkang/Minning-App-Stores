Gets worse with every update Considering Samsung uses this app to market its Note series, I'm shocked the app works the way it does. Crashing from just toggling layer visibility is common, along with the new problem of the display still showing an undone line. It's weird, and annoying. Please fix these bugs, the previous Sketchbook used to run flawlessly, then this buggy mess came along...
