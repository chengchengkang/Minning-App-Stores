Awful This is far from real time. I have yet to look up, see an airplane and find it on the app. I don't know how delayed it is, but it is substantial. They didn't say anything about how severely delayed it is in the description. 
I find it deceiving and they should be reported to apple corp. 
Don't waste your money.
