Dreadful update of once-loved app Title says it all. This was once one of my favorite apps and a great way to skim new science articles and read whatever first appealed. New UI means you have to hit a million buttons to find anything (if you can!) and there is no way to simply skim a variety of topics and enjoy. You have to have an idea in advance what might grab your attention--not at all, judging by the many negative reviews of the update, now a lot of us used the app.

Sometimes simpler is better, guys. I have tried playing with this new version and am so disheartened I am deleting it instead. :(

I would give zero stars if I could. Bummer.
