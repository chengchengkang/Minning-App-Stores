Crisis of function I am a huge fan of discovery news but I am sad to see bugs go unaddressed for so long.  Articles get display errors that cut off content (close and reopen until content can be seen) and any attempt to share a story crashes and closes the Application.  In a pinch, I go to the mobile website and share from there off Chrome's built in "share" feature.

I don't understand why there hasn't even been even an attempt to address the problems (so far as we know).  I have not had an update on this App yet.
