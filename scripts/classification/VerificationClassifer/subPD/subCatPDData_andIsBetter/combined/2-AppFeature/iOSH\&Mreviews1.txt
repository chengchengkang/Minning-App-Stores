Tracking Packages It's a good app that allows easy browsing though all the merchandise offered. The only problem is when I try to track my package. It brings up the screen, but the boxes that show the location of the sending package are distorted and pushed down into eachother to where you can't read them. I would appreciate some work on that part so I can know where my package is. It does the same thing if you go online and try track the package.
