Works with 2012 VT-50 but has some bugs I never write reviews but I saw this concept at CES 2013 and was very scared. I had just bought a 2012 panasonic vt-50 2 months before and I figured this new swipe and share would not work then I saw on the app works with 2011+ TVs. I installed the app the remote works better than the first panasonic app but even with the vt50, AirPort Extreme and ipad mini there is still a lot of lag in the remote function. I did try the swipe and share and it worked once out of the couple times but there is no guide to help so I don't know of I am doing something wrong. I think it may have a lot of bugs also I have not updated my tv firmware which is strange I would have thought swipe and share would have needed a firmware update to work. (I do have newest firmware but it is old) also I think a better name would have helped I just randomly found this app. Still a lot if work but moving in right direction.
