Doesn't show a planes and slow Since I live near Boston's Logan Airport (BOS) and can see most of the live air traffic,  I thought it might be entertaining to view the air traffic on the app to verily with what I was seeing live. I can see almost all planes taking off and landing from my house. But it doesn't show all airlines and all planes and it only works 50% of the time.
