Time to delete I've had the old app for years and were very happy with the list format. I don't
mind the tiles, colors and the fancy schmancy new design, but I can't read anything offline anymore and since my commute implies a 40 minute (underground) train ride this morning I was staring at a bunch of titles that I couldn't read. Please let me go back to the previous format... Before I updated the app I checked 'what's new' and all it said was 'bug fixes'... I guess the other format was a bug...
