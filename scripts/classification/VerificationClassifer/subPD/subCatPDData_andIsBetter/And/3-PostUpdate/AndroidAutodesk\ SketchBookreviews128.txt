WORK COMPLETELY DELETED!! I actually love the functionality of this app and what Auto desk is trying to do with integration and sharability across platforms, but if it comes at the expense of updates causing work to be COMPLETELY DELETED WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING ON IT then that makes this a meaningless app. Work on a project for over four hours, make a stroke, screen goes blank white. DONE. WTF?
