Garbage. Lured in because nothing gives you the impression that you can't stream live TV through Chromecast. (You can't) Also, Cincinnati Bell is listed as a provider but it never really lets you log in. The website pops up an empty white box with an "OK" button that logs you out when clicked. Disappointed.
