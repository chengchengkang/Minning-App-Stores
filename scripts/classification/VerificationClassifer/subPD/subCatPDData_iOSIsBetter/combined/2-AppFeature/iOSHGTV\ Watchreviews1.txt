Missing Fixer Upper I think that this app is great. It doesn't have any bugs, runs smoothly, and loads quickly. However, my favorite show is missing, Fixer Upper. I don't understand why the show isn't on the app when the show still airs on TV and has a lot of fans. Please try to add Fixer Upper soon!
