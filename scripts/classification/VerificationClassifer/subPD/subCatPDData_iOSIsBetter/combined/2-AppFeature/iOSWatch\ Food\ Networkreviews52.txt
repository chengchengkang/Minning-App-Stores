Too many commercials One of the joys of digital has been the limited number of commercials, this can no longer be said for the Food Network. There are multiple commercial interruptions of repetitive ads during a single program. It's disruptive and annoying and makes me turn it off and spend my time with other apps that don't bombard me with ads.
