Error Message I just want to watch Suits and I just download the app. I tried to log in with my Charter email address and received this message: Apologize for the inconvenience. We are working on this issue. Please try logging back after 24 hours. So I checked back after 24 hours and it still doesn't work. Customer service is also a joke!
