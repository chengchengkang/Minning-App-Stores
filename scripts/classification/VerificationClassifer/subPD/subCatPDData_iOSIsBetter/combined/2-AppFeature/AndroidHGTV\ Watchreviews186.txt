Commercials!!!! I honestly do not mind commercials when watching my favorite shows but it has gotten to the point where I fear them greatly. When the show breaks for a commercial it never returns back to the show. Just a blank white advertisement screen. Basically I can only watch the beginning of each show. Never past the first commercial break. Fix it and I would love to raise the stars up
