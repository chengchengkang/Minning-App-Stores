Doesn't let me watch my shows I originally got this app to watch property brothers and it had told me to put in my info about my tv provider so I did.  And I supposedly I wasn't allowed to watch it because of stupid parental controls. So  I went onto the tv providers website as it told me to do and when i checked my settings it said that the parental controls were already disabled so I don't know what to do or were to change it.
