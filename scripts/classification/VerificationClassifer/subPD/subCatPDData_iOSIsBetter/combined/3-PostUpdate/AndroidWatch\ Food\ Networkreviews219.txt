Update screwed it up! I absolutely LOVED this app until the update! What happened? I used to be able to watch any show without a problem, now it will only play for a couple of minutes & then freeze, stop, or crash! Very frustrating!  I'm almost forced to completely remove the app since there really is no point if you can even watch the shows! & I kno it's not my phone or connection since I have NO other problems with other apps or streaming! PLEASE FIX!!!
