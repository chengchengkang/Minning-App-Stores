Crashes. All. The. Time. Agree w/ all other reviews: crashes. All. The. Time. Whether @home on Wifi or streaming in the car. I've used this app w/ an iPhone 4, 5s & now 6; same problems. Also noticed that latest version has bugs mentioned: when you pause playback it will start from beginning of program when you start again, finding what song is being played is nearly impossible w/ the playlist. KCRW rocks but this app is just sad. Will still support w/ hope they work on it 🙏 please!
