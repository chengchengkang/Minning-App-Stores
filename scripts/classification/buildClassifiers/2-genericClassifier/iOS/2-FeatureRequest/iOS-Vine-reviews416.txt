its good but
i love vine i literally go on the app every single day. i love the good edits and funny videos that people make and i like making videos of my own, but the only thing that i think would make vine better, is if it were to have a layout similar to instagram. as in the three rows of pictures/videos. and have an option to scroll through the videos one, by one. im saying this because the other day, i was trying to scroll all they way down through my 3,907 likes on vine to see what the first thing i ever liked was. but when i scrolled through say 100 vines the app closed out on me. and also i think this would be a good idea to scroll down quicker. if you take this into consideration; thank you! o(liv)ia mellark on vine.
