Change please.
This game was great I loved it, the soundtracks, blades, backgrounds , etc. The game today, (3/29/15), is still good, but the only problem is the main theme. Halfbrick just ruined it. The original theme was fantastic, gorgeous, but someone had the idea to make like a weird tune remix out of it. It just does not appeal to me as much as it used to . Same goes for my friends, they don't play it because of that change specifically. Yes one song can make a big difference from not playing and playing. So anyway please fix the theme song. The theme from "Enter Gutsu and Truffles" video has the original soundtrack, but compare it to the current version and its not the same . THIS NEXT PART IS FOR NEWCOMERS AT FRUIT NINJA!: Don't be talking smack about my comment because you wouldn't understand, but for those old timers who got this when it came out, you guys know what I'm talking about. CHANGE PLEASE AND I WILL PUT 5 STARS!
