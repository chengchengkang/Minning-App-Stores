Gr8 for paying , but needs store updates
Gr8 for paying , but needs store updates It's great to get my rewards and also see the special offers. I wish they could combine the email offers for gold stars into the app. It works fine for paying and getting normal rewards after 12 stars, but the store database needs redoing and especially stores that now close at midnight but the drive thru is open till 1 a.m. really throws off everything, if you decide to head that way only to find out they're closed and you didn't want to go through the drive thru.
