Disappearing "notepad " Doubt anyone at Twitter will read this, my simple request for improved accessibility for the disabled didn't even get a "sorry, not possible". However, as this is making typing new tweets nearly impossible, maybe someone will look. The "what's happening?" box keeps shrinking to virtually invisible, with 2 other small boxes for adding pics and something else to its RHS. The original box returned after latest update which I did about 12 hrs ago. By 5 hrs ago it had returned to the impossible state.Please fix!
