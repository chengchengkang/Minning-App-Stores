There's no more discover,which was the best part,videos play audio but show just a black screen,I always open up twitter to old tweets and I have to scroll all the way up from where I originally left off before closing the app. Sometimes I'm not even notified if someone mentions me and comments on tweets don't load. FIX THIS
