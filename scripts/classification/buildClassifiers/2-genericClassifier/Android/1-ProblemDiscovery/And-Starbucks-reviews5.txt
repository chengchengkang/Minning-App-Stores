Better since newest update
Better since newest update Update: The app is way better since the latest update. I still can't use Paypal or Visa to reload card, but at least I don't have to constantly uninstall/reinstall to get app to work!  You'll get 5 Stars once i can reload card with Paypal.  //  With V2.7.1 I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall to use it. Can no longer use paypal or my visa card which I added to reload, must have cashier reload for me. This is no longer a good app!!!! Devos, fix this before giving us new stuff!!!!  Full Review
