Works great for me and always has
I have used this app since it was first announced by UPS.  Love it.  It has always worked well and keeps getting better.  Especially love that I can see unexpected packages, not just my own orders!  The other day I used for the first time the reschedule option to have a package requiring a signature that missed me at home to be redirected to my local UPS Store, where pick up was convenient and easy.  Because of that, I finally decided to write a review.  Imagine my surprise when I came to the App Store to write it up and discovered the low stars and poor reviews!  I'd never looked it up so didn't know.  All I can say is I have had it since UPS released it (got it upon their announcement), have gone through all the updates, and migrated it from iPhone 4 to 6.  It has uniformly worked flawlessly for me.  Can't figure out why anyone else has a problem with logging in and using it.
