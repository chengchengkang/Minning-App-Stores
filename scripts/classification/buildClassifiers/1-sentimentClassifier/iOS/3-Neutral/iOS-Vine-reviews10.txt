I love vine but ugh two problems.... Bullying and how short the vines are
I love vine so much it's a really nice app that makes me happy but the only two problems is 1. The bullying, is there anyway you can add an option if you want people to comment on your vine or not. Everyday I see viners and other people getting bullied and it's really sick. Please fix this problem thank you! And 2. How short vines are. If you can't fix this problem it's ok but is there anyway you can create vines to be longer. It'll be more interesting and funny to watch my favorite viners longer. Thanks a lot and please, please, please look at these problems that are going on with vine.
