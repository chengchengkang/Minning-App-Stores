Notification sounds not updating July 27th, is it a joke?  Constant updates with no change. is it really that difficult?  Do you listen to your users? Update after update with no change.  Yet ANOTHER update but STILL no resolution to notification sounds just reverting back to default on the newest android devices. Come on twitter, catch up to the newest phones. Add a "save" button on sounds screen! !! It's been months. I'm about to delete. So annoying.
