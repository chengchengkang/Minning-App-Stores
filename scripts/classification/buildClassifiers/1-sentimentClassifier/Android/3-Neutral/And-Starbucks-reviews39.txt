Great but not perfect.
Great but not perfect. I love seeing those star bounce into my coffee cup but there should be some kind of confirmation that are making progress on a challenge.  I used to have to "enter" them and would at least get a confirmation screen.  Now apparently they are preloaded to my account but this current one doesn't show up under rewards.  There should be some sort of tracking to confirm that I am moving forward on my 3 Frappuccino challenge.  Full Review
