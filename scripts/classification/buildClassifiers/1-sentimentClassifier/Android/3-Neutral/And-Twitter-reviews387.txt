App is OK, but could be better The app is easy to use but when it comes to updates, the app refuses to even open if the newest update isn't installed IMMEDIATELY. And if that wasn't bad enough, I have to waste time keeping my phone screen on and watching the dumb thing download because otherwise it never will. I'd appreciate not having to babysit this app, you're wasting my time and my battery :)
