When it works, it's still only okay I have been a member of Stardoll for about four years now, and I loved it when I was younger. Now that I'm a bit older, I still find it fun, but I don't go on nearly as often. In order to keep my account active (and avoid deletion), I check in on the app to see what's new if I don't have a whole lot of time. Now, since I've updated to iOS 8, it only shows me a black screen, rendering it impossible to check in, which forces me to use my laptop. Usually Stardoll hasn't been on top of things, and I'm assuming that it will be quite a while until Stardoll updates. The app itself isn't something I particularly love, either, because you can only do a fraction of the things you can on the website.

UPDATE: iOS 8 still does not work with the update.
