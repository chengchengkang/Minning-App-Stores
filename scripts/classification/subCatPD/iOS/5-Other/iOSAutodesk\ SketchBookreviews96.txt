I am left handed too! I having been trying to use my Intuos stylus with sketchbook, and with how dorked-out the lack of left-handed support makes my interface, I might as well be drawing right-handed (I am in no way ambidextrous). I know there aren't many of us south paws, but please keep us in mind. It's like golf club shopping all over again.
