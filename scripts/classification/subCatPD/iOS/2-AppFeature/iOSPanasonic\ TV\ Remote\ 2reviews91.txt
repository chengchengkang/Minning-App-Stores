So called "smarttv" It connects fine to my st50. Issue 1, media share stopped working when it worked fine in last version. 2, browser is useless, why would I want to play the sound through my sound system and not watch the video on my monitor. Thought that was the point. I am sure it will be fixed for the next generation and they won't give us the the software upgrades.
