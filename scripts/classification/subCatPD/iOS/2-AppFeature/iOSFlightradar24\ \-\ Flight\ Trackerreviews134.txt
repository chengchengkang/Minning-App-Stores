Fair but not great Too often it shows aircraft in the vicinity that aren't there, other times I'm looking at an aircraft and cannot locate it on the tracker.  I understand that if the aircraft isn't sending a signal it can't be tracked but I'm not happy about the high number of discrepancies I've identified.  An OK app but I'm looking for something better.
