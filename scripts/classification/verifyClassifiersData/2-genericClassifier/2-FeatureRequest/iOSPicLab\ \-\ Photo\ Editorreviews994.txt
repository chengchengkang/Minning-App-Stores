Needs to go back to the old layout.
The app is great. But now that the layout is totally different and contains LOTS of issues, I really don't like this app anymore, and it needs to go back to the old way it was. And also, I'm not a fan of the watermark taking up half the picture. Because no, I will not buy the full version so I don't have to put up with the water mark.
