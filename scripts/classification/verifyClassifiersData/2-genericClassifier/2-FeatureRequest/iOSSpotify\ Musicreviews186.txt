5 ‚≠ê service, but the app needs improvement.
Great music service, listen to what you want, when you want it, where you want it. 

If the issues mentioned below get addressed Spotify will put them selfs at the top without competition. 

1. But music discovery (a big deal for music lovers) leave me disappointed. The playlists available pale in comparison to what you find in Songza or Apple Music. 

2. App navigation is not the best or most fluid. Still needs improvement so that power users can flow through the different sections when putting playlists together. Like, I should have access to the search bar and the main menu from all screens! Not having to back out through layers. 

3. Family pricing needs to be adjusted. When it compares to Apple Music, I'll move the whole family over to Spotify. 

Pro Tip: when using search there are songs that you can find in the desktop that do not show up on the mobile app. So you would have to find them first on the desktop them save them to a playlist to listen in mobile.
