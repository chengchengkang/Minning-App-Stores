Please stop making things hard
The new update is THE worst thing you could've ever done. Not only is it a hassle to look at who has viewed my story but also the discovery channels and the live feeds CANT be hidden which makes me unenjoy snapchat all together. I rarely use the app now since the new update. SC was so much fun when it was simple. You are complicating things that don't need it. Please change it back.
