Would love an option to keep "Hold to View" instead of reverting. I used to really love Snapchat because it meant communicating with pictures fun, but it was also easy to use. A 4 star app. Hold down as long as you want, and importantly, if it's a picture you don't want to see, just let go of the screen, and you can see the next picture later. I realize the move to tap instead of hold is a big marketing move as big as it is a design move, but at least having to option to keep the old hold to view would make this a 5 star app for the first time.
