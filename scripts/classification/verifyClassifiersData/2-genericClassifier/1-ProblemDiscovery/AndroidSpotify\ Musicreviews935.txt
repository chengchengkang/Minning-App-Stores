Please fix! It used to work great! But then it updated and nothing works. When I click onto the app, it stays on a blank black screen, then freezes. I loved it before the update. Would've given it at least 4 stars, probably 5.  I've uninstalled, then reinstalled, but it didn't work. I was even thinking about upgrading to premium before it stopped working! If it doesn't get fixed in uninstalling for good.
