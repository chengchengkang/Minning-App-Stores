No instant access Premium user here. It's been ten minutes since I launched Spotify and Playlists, Search, Activity and Browse are still unavailable. If I want to use any of those features I have to launch the app and then go do something else  (like have a cup of coffee ) while I wait. Why is this happening? It didn't used to.
