Having problems with logging in
I would definitely give the app 5 stars but recently I have been having problems with my login screen. Every time I go to log in and I type my email address and password and hit log in it says "You've already created an account with this email address." I already know that I created an account with this email address , that's why I'm using it to login so I can listen to my music. Please fix. It's really annoying the crap out of me. I'm actually in the log in screen not the sign up section . I'm not an idiot.
