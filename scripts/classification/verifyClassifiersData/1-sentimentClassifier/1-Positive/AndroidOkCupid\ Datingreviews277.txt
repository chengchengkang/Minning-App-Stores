Decent App Once in a while freezes up, or misfunctions, but over all its good. Just hate when I hit back on my phone it always asks of I want to exit.   Still can't get use to that change. Also as far as it being a dating site, not an awesome or responsive group of people.  Just like real world dating I guess.
