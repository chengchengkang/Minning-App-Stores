AMAZING but...
I love this app so much it has all the songs I love but they'd Gould really change it so you don't need wifi. I would delete all of my other music apps and this would make the app beat the competition like pandora or iTunes and songza. This would define fly be the go to app. I mean it already is but that would make it way better.
