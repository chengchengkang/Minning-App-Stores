Met a couple decent people here, then the app started functioning strangely two days ago.
I would rate the app higher if all of a sudden everybody didn't stop replying to me all at once. Two weeks ago I was meeting and having dates with people, now all of a sudden nobody replies or even visits my profile. I'm positive this is a technical issue. But I have no idea how to resolve it. Had a couple of arguments with prospective dates about different opinions on certain subjects but I don't think that's would hinder my results all of a sudden. Other than that the people who I have met and have had dates with have been wonderful. But the quality of the matches is inconsistent with what I'm looking for. Keeps showing me profiles of people I'm not attracted to and not advertising for. I'm even getting men in my results. Please fix this then I'll rate the app higher. Thank you
