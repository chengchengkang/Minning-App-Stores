Downgraded to one star like the not having to hold down the screen in order to see a snap but that's about the only thing I like. I don't want to see the "live" sections so no sense in even having them load and slow the rest down. Would like to be able to hide them again, And this STILL isn't a news app so might as well leave "discover" on another page or better yet, take it off.
