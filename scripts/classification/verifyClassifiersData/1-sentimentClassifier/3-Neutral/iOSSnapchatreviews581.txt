camera and filter issues
it seems as if many of snapchat users (mainly on an iPod 5th gen) are having major issues on flipping the camera from selfie mode to read mode. also the battery filters and filters in general are not corresponding and showing up according to location. if you can please help us out and fix these issues we'd all appreciate it for a better experience!! thank you ðŸ˜Š
