Wonderful!
It is as it shows. Click what you want to order and away you go.

One thing I might consider changing on the app, after you close out a coupon but before completing the order how do I add to it? I love the 2 or more for $5.99, and when I had a second thought about adding another pie, I had to delete the coupon and reorder. Simple bug fix, or maybe me overly picky.
