Eh
The experience was meh. I felt between the bots and people not wanting to chat made the place rather boring. Oh funny part I had a few people like me and don't even chat. It's stupid to put someone on your like list and not chat. So you either get that or tons of women with high expectations. It's a hit or miss or eat your heart out. After a week of being around I found myself not into the online dating site thing. Just isn't worth it to me vs just meeting people out of no where in person.
