Very glitchy On my galaxy s6 edge snapchat is very glitchy and the camera takes so long to load. Also if I take a video and try to use a filter it freezes and if I put it on my story it automatically deletes. What I don't understand is why snapchat is so glitchy on this phone and for basically all androids but on my iphone 5s I had, snapchat worked flawlessly. I love snapchat and use it everyday but these issues a very frustrating. Please fix!
