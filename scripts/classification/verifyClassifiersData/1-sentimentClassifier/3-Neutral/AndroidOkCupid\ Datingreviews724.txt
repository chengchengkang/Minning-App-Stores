A-list issue In the current version (5/10/15) of you click to see the people who have liked you get a notice that A-list members get to see all the likes they have.  But for non-A-list people there does not appear to be any way to see any likes at all. Is that a bug or a feature? If it is a feature I will be uninstalling it soon.
