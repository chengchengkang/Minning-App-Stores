Eh
Sometimes this app is great. But other times it isn't. You have to pay for a limited time use to pick whatever song you want, and listen to it without wifi. On the computer you don't have to do that... AND when I turn it on it says, thanks to the following ad you'll get 30min of ad free listening. After the ad finishes, spotlight crashes. I reopen it and it plays one song, and then I get 2 ads before playing another song. Excuse me spotify that is not a half hour of ad free listening.
