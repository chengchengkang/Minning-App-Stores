I use it all the time Sometimes glitches and won't let me take a video until I restart my phone. One thing that could make this app better is the addition of an eraser to the drawing function. Also regarding the drawing function, you should be able to make the other buttons disappear while you draw so you can draw where the send button is without having to drag it from elsewhere. Also a blend tool and a fill tool would be nice.
