SNAPCHAT! READ THE REVIEWS AND FIX SNAPCHAT!
Thanks to the genius idea of updating snapchat, do many things are wrong with it now. The one thing I hate is that is now it doesn't work on the only device I can Snapchat on, my 4th generation iPod! No you see I don't have enough money for a 5th, which means I am stuck with a 4th. Please make it so it can be used without iOS 7.
