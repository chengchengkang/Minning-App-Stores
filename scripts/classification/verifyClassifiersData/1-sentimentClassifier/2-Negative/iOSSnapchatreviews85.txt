Stories are SOOO SLOW
It takes me hours to watch my friends' stories 😑😩😒
And I also don't get the double “discover” feature 😐 Why don't just swipe once more if you want to see discover? 😐
I love the circles idea for the live stories and all but it's getting to bother me all the time I've to wait to even watch a hole story... Out of the twenty I want to watch.

Please Fix This 🙏🏼😩
