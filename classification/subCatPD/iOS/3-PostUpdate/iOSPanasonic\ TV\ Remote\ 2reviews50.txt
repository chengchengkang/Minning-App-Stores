Terrible update February 2014 Was pretty good and simple to choose device and control.  Now I can't even click on any device and when you get to that screen you can't leave it at all since the only way to return to home screen is to click on a tv.  Do they even test these?  Maybe it's only a problem if you have 2 or more tvs to control.  But before it was no problem.
