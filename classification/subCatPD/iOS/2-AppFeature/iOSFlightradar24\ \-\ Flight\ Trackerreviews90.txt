Not what it pretends to be!!! Hell yes it is an amazing app when it catches a flight correctly. Unfortunatelly most of the time aircrafts do not appear during all the flight and their schedules are never up to date until the aircraft itself is ONLINE. So it is useless if there is a delay and we aren't informed in time! Besides, there is no possibility to see the full route when you zoom out the map. The blue line disappears. Last but not least, i didn't find a way to contact Flight Radar support. Their FAQ is not complete.
