Conflicted... This is the hardest review I've ever had to write. On one hand the clothes from H&M are fantastic, and the app is very attractive and well done. But not being able to buy from the app or site is a HUGE problem. I went to all three stores near me looking for items on the app, and none had any of them. Please please please allow purchases through the app, like right now... I'll wait here!
