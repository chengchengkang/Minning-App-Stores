Fascinating I tried the free version but almost immediately bought the premium version. I've often wondered about the origins and destination of aircraft flying overhead and now not only is that revealed, but much more. I was able to track my wife's flight from Abu Dhabi back home to Paris. Yes, I can strongly recommend this.
