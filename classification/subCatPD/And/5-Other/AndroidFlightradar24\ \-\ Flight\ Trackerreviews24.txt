Just keeps getting better June 2015: I can't praise the developers of this app highly enough! Every time I hear a rumble in the sky above, I reach for my phone and start the app, tap location to zoom in on my home location and i see what's passing overhead and 99% of the time the aircraft is shown on the display, I grab my binoculars, look up and I can see the airline I am seeing on the map.
