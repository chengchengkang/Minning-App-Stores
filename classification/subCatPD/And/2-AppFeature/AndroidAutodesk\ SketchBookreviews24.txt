The apps great after all of the updates its  had since its release.release. I'm a avid user of sketchbook pro so this is great when away form the computer.I rarely have lag,and no crashes lately.the app isn't perfect of course though.On my tablet the time lapse feature doesn't exist,but on my phone it does.I dont really know whats the deal with that.I was excited to see that being implemented for android after it being on ios for some time.but besides.besides that now the app is perfectly usable.
