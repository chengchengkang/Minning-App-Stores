Useful but clunky.  This app is useful, no question there. You can consult your account, snap pictures of checks and have it deposited in your account and make other standard transactions. Very convenient in that sense.  But I also find it very slow and a bit cumbersome at times so for me, it does not pass the "OK" level. Starting the app takes time (comparing to any other apps on my hone and similar app from other financial institution) ... really (really) a while to load. It also takes sometime to get accustom to this app and menus as all HSBC interfaces I have to say - their Web based login is terribly frustrating, too many steps to even get to a useful page. In that sense, this app will be easier. Finally, leaving this app is also a frustration - why do I have to confirm multiple times I want to leave? I just want to leave this app, one click one confirm should be enough but no! Not for HSBC. You confirm you want to log out, then go back to the front screen and have to do it again (stand on one foot, tap on top of your head, click twice yes and eventually you will get back to your phone - at least, this is how it feels). No crash though.
