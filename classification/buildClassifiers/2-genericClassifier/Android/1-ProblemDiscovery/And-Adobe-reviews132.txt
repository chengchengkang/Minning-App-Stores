Previous version 5 stars This version has been repeatedly crashy. Never happened before this version but happens so repeatedly now that I am not willing to waste my time with it but eagerly looking forward to it becoming more reliable. It also won't save an image. So of it doesn't crash, it still won't save it. Please fix this. Thanks.
