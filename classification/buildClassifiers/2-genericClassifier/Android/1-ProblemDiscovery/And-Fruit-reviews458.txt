Not worth paying for Getting a lot of forced closed errors on a brand new S5 with only a few other apps installed. As soon as fruit is thrown at the start of a game in any mode, the game just closes. Phone is 2 weeks old, not a memory issue. Disappointing as I paid for the game outright and it only works occasionally. Not to mention the forced popups to play other Halfbrick games is infuriating. When I slice to start a new game but first have to close a popup? Please, put that ad anywhere else in the game.
