Do not use
I love this app. I got my wife hooked. We would use it all the time. I just got hacked not even on wifi at Starbucks. The crooks took $200 by using the card reload. I do have to credit Starbucks got refunded and closed my account easily. Sorry to see it go. If you don't mind getting hacked use it. It's great while it lasted.
