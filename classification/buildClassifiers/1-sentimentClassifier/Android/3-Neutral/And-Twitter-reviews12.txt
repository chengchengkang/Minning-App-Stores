I don't know why but I can't see my mentions in my notifications tab. I'll get the notification that someone tweeted me but then when I go to the actual notifications tab to see it, the tweet doesn't show up. This is so weird because it was working fine this morning. Please tell me if there's anything I can do to fix this. If there's not anything I can do, hopefully there's something the twitter people can do and it will be fixed soon because it's a huge inconvenience. Thanks.
