Another Downgrade
I'm already enrolled in UPS My Choice Premium, yet now I am asked to re-enroll? I'm not even able to access any of the services that I'm paying for in the first place, so what is the point in attempting to sign up again? At least on the iPad app I can make the selections that I'm paying for, but this iPhone app is useless.
