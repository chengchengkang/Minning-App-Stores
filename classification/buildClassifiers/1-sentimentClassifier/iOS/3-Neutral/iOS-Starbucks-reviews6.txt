Great app over all but...
It is a great app. Easy to navigate and understand. You can build and save recipes and have your favorite drinks ready as soon as you walk in. The only thing it needs is to be able to add and pay with a real credit card instead of having to buy and reload a Starbucks gift card. Come on developers! I bet more people will use the app if you add that feature!
