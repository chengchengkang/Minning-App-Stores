Loved it until... The latest update when all of a sudden my Bluetooth headphones will play a song like normal which is awesome then as soon as the next song starts they immediately disconnect then about 30 seconds to 1 minute into the song it reconnect and then repeatedly repeats the process with every song, at first I thought it was my headphones themselves however after using them with other devices and media programs it all points back to only being an issue with spotify even on other devices please fix it.
