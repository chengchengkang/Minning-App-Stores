Good but wish the app had more features This is the best app I have found for tracking my stocks on my phone. I wish there was a way to display more of the portfolio data similar to what's found on the website.  It would also be nice to edit holdings via the app. I've noticed too that some of the news links are older than the website for multiple ticker symbols. Reading through the posts, I do appreciate that someone is actively monitoring these!
