$10 a month for a glitch filed app Note 4 user, consistently hangs, freezes etc. Takes forever to load up. Works better connected to my wifi at home. Cuts in and out all the time. When imusic is available I'll try it to see if it works any better. The sound quality when it is working is good it's just a constant frustration. I just want to listen music not spend all my time trying figure out why it isn't.
