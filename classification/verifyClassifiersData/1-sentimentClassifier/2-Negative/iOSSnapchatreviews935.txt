New Update
Firstly, the new update is annoying because of the live stream that can't be given the option of "not see this". Also the discovery being below the story is also very meaningless if they're supposed to have their "own page". I would suggest to keep it like the old update that you can only watch it in their page as well as giving the option to not see the live stream. Other than that the user can get used to the other features but those are the most irritating.
