I'm having to uninstall and now reinstall this app because it won't let me do anything. I can't send snaps, receive them, get notifications, stay logged in... Nothing. I'm trying to troubleshoot the problem any way i can, including redownloading it, but now it won't even let me do that! This app sucks. I don't know what you did to ruin it, but its probably better that i don't have this app any more.
