Awesome
Ever since pandora started charging and Verizon got rid of unlimited data... I really haven't found an app that works for me , but this is awesome . You can set the playlist to off line mode and you won't use any of your data . And every song I've ever needed is here, organized to perfection . Not to mention I got a 50% discount for being a student !!!
