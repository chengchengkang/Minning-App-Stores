Really like the app, but it has some problems... This is the best song app ever, you can find any song you want, the only problem is that it uses P2P, which it takes a lot of my internets bandwidth, and that really is a bother cause I live in a country that the internet is very slow, so now it's even more slow thanks to P2P!
