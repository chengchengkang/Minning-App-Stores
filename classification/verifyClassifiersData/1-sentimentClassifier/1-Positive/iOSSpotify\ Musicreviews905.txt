Lovely, but why is Premium so expensive?
I love ways to have free music while giving money to the rightful artists!! I am a bit annoyed at the fact that the mobile version will randomly play "recommended songs" which do not relate to my taste at all, but the computer free app does not have this problem. I'd love to see the mobile and computer apps get more similar. But it's a great app, and the playlists they display are actually really good!
