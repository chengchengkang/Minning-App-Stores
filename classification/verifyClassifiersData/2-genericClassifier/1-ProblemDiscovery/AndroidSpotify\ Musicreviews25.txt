Update I loved the app before this newest update for the Galaxy S5. It's not near as good as it used to be. And the new set up isn't near as easy. It keeps undownloading songs that will have been downloaded before. -- Now song names and artist aren't playing under the cover art. I don't know about you, but I have multiple songs from the same album and would like to know what I'm listening to at a quick glance. Fix it.
