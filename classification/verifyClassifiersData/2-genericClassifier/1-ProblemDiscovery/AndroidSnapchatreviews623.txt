Terrible for android, please fix. I really like this app, but it is increasingly frustrating to use. I don't get to see many of the snaps I recieve, as the app acts like I've already viewed them (when I have not). Also, many videos and snaps I upload to my story disappear entirely, and are never even added. Not to mention, the video recording fails at least half of the time, making it impossible to capture what I intended to, and the video has been choppy when it does record. I just want to enjoy this app without constant frustration.
