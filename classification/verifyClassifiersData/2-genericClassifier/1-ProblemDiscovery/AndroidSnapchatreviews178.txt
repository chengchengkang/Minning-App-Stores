Videos skip/freeze I'm using the app on the Galaxy S6 Active and every time I try to play a video it skips (like a scratched CD. That's literally how it sounds) or it freezes. At this point all other changes/enhancements to the app are irrelevant if the basic function/purpose of the app doesn't work. Please fix this asap.
