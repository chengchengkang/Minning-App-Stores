Love the app keeps me connected to family and friends but maybe about a month ago its beed really slow receiving and sending massages and pictures and videos. Every so often it stays trying to connect. Yesterday it crashes to the point where i had to delete the app and re download, why i dont know. And most of my contacts the resent time doesn't appear amd sometime they're online and it doens say its just blank! Try to fix please !! Still 5 stars keep up the work
