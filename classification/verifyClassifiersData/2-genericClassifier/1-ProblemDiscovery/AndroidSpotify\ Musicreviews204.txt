What Happened?! I love Spotify but I hate the update! When I play my music via bluetooth, it will play one song and then stop the bluetooth. I pay 10.81 a month and am a loyal customer. This is so infuriating!  I have a Samsung galaxy S3 and the other two devices are S5's. We all have the same problem. Please fix this! Also, we all like the other green color better.
