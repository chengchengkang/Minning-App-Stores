Seems dead ðŸ’€
The app itself and site work pretty good and you can't beat free. However, it seems like most people have left this dating site for other hipper/new dating sites. This is the last time I will ever join Cupid. It's full of old dead profiles, swingers, girls with aids, transgender men posing as woman, super overweight girls, and fake profile identity thieves. I quit after 2 days. It's disheartening not being able to find one normal girl.
