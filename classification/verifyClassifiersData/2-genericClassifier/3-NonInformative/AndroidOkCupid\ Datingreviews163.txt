Intuitive, detailed, dishonest Some of the questions seem kinda creepy, talking about hardcore porn and normalizing porn and all, but I guess that's part of the theme. It says you can bypass a full inbox, which is kind of stupid, by paying 99 cents, but when you click on it, it charges a dollar. They're just trying to make it seem like its not as much money, so you'll be more likely to pay. That being said, I think it's my favorite dating app. From just an app standpoint, it is very fluid and streamlined, and very well put together.
