The ELEPHANT in the room
There's a huge elephant in the room that none of these reviewers seem to be addressing, and that's attractiveness. If you are above average looking (or even slightly above average) THIS SITE IS NOT FOR YOU. This site is mainly comprised of unattractive males. Interestingly enough, if you look at the female user base the majority are at least slightly above average. This site will not serve you well unless you are unattractive or okay with dating down. I have been through hundreds of profiles and saw 3 decent men tops. This is not a regional thing. I've checked in other states and they also have this issue. Attractive men do not use this site. This is a site for unattractive people to meet. Don't waste your time.
