I love this app so much.
I've had spirit for like 4 years now and I've never had a gripe with it. It's amazing I love having unlimited music, I love the selection, I love that it helps support the artist, I love the discover feature. The aesthetic, green and black are two of my favorite colors. It's amazing and even though I used it because I didn't have iTunes when I was on my Samsung devices, and even though now I do and Apple has introduced Apple music. I will support spotify until it no longer exists :D great job spotify team
