Suggestion - image forwarding Something which would be very helpful, would be if I can forward an image with the text from the previous chat. Instead of having to re-type the message. Would be better if i could at least edit the previous message with the image when forwarding to the next chat. Please update whatsapp to be able to do this. Would be very helpful and would make my experience with whatsapp much better.
