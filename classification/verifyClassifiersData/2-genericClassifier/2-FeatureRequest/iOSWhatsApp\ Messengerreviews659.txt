COMMUNICATION ✈️📱☎️🌍
Software: iPhone 5

This is a great app. I love the new feature where you can make a phone call to anyone else who has the app. It's also great for communicating with people around the world. If they just added a video chat feature then this app would have it all. Personally I am not the fan of the new way to send a voice note it's very annoying. Sometimes voice notes send by themselves or don't send at all and you have to send a new one all over again. Over all I recommend this app and I would only change the voice note problems.
