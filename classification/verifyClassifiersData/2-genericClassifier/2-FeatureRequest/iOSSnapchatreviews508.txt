Just Keeps Getting Worse
Okay, so I used to love snapchat, it was a cool,fun, and easy app to use to communicate with friends and have a glimpse of other ppls daily lives. Then, your updates started. Every update made the app worse and worse. You took away the best friends feature, which most of your users were and still are pretty upset about. Now you made seeing who viewed your story harder and rearranged the whole layout. And no one cares about Discover, it gets in the way and wastes data. Now, snapchat wont let me log into my account, saying "You're using an outdated version.Update, etc." I'm using an Ipod 4 because I don't have my phone now. So it doesn't go past ios 6. So I am using an outdated version of Snapchat. However, I tried logging in from a friend's account and it worked. But it won't let me log in from my account. FIX IT!!!!
