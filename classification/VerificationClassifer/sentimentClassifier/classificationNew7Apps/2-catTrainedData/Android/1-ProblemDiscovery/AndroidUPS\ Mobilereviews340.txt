Just what I want out of a UPS app This app has all of the features I expect out of a UPS app, is light weight, and has no feature bloat. The branding in the app compliments the UPS brand nicely, while the UI and UX feel native to Android making it very easy to interact with. The barcode scanner is nice, and it is nice that the Recently Tracked Packages are sitting there on the homepage when the app is started. My only minor complaint is around the social sign in dialog seeming to not successfully close out when properly authenticated, but that could be a problem on Facebook's end. Keep up the good work!
