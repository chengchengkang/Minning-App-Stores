Angelic Me It was working great until the new update and now all of a sudden it keeps freezing everytime I try to watch a vine, and it keeps on taking off the loops. Like for example I would have like 1,000 loops on a video I posted then all of a sudden the app crashes and now I have 300 loops soo.
