UPS I suppose the app works, in a general sense. But it is not useful. For example: my current package (according to the app) is "in transit" and "on time" for delivery today 6/26/15. But below that the delivery date is shown as 7/4/15. Still further below that the "package progress" shows the package in New Jersey, a continent away. From my point of view the package is lost, UPS has no idea where it is and they have no idea when it'll  be delivered. If only they could program the app to damage my package...
