A Gaudy Mess
This update is an aesthetic nightmare. The timeline uses so much white space and employs such a lack of definition that the tweets bleed together in a disorganized mess. The ads are now so ridiculously invasive I'd rather just not go on twitter. Why sift through a sea of poorly defined content with HUGE ads taking up the lion's share of space? I'm disappointed.
