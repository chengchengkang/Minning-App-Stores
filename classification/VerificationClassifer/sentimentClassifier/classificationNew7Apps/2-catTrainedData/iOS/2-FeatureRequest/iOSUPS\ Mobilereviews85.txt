One MAJOR feature needed..
Some sort of "Notes to Driver" feature NEEDS to be added for deliveries!! For some reason, UPS can never find my house that is VERY easy to find. I have tried to stop using them whenever possible. (Every other company can find it!) but if there was a spot where I could send a note to the driver, 2 lines even!, it would ALOT easier on me and UPS!!
