FOLLOWERS IN COMMON???
I have one request at the moment:
Before I let someone follow me, I want to know how I'm connected to them or if they're just a random stranger. When I get an email telling me that I have a request then it has a link telling me what followers we have in common.
For example: @16389A and you have 5 followers in common, and it list the people.
Can you manage to put that on the Twitter site itself? A common followers list/link/whatever you choose to call it, part?
