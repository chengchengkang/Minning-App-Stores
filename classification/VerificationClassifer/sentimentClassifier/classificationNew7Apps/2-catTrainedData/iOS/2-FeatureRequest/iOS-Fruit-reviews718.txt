I miss the old one!!!
For some reason even though I updated on my phone I still have ghostbusters mode. I hate it because it is not as fun and I can not get different backgrounds and blades. Also I don't like the new update because it is all different. I miss the older version where I could just play the game without all these weird people that keep coming up with messages. Can't it just go back to normal.
