Glitches Glitches Glitches
I like Twitter when it actually works my TL hasn't refreshed in over 33 minutes I know that my wifi is working fine though because I'm still getting all the notifications for when someone favorites my tweets and I can load people profiles if I search them but my actual TL is not refreshing right now and it's not the first time that this issue has occurred but I can say that it is the longest and I also hope that it is the last.
