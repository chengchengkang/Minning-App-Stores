Refresher review
Refresher review Ok my favorite drink at Starbucks is the orange refresher witch Starbucks has discontinued :-( well that's not all they have done! They have shrunk the size of large one this I know because I have a cup from the movies dollar refills. I like the orange refresher so much I would get one and put it in my regal cup before a movie. The lid fit my cup and the drink fill the cup after a two drinks before pouring the refresher in it. So I am not happy about this stuff! On top Starbucks started 5 drink card :-( !  Full Review
