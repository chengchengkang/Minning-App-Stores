For me, it's the best possible photo editor It needs much power from your device, because image changes that it can make are sophisticated. (For the device, not for the user!) I could only say that my Nexus 5 with quad-core CPU and 2 GB RAM handles it well. AND ALL THE $17 Bucks that I have paid before an year ago worth %100 all the futures of the App! There is no better photo editor! It's just amazing! I am waiting joyfully now for the current development by Adobe of Full Photoshop version for Chrome OS.
