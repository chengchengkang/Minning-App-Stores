Good Overall
I've had this app for a few years now and it's steadily improving. The gas price search is probably the most used feature for me. Other categories have improved as well. Search filters are useful. The main issue with this latest version is a lack of ability to sort gas price search results. It defaults to sorting by nearest rather than giving the ability to choose, say, by price.  Overall, though, it's a decent app.
