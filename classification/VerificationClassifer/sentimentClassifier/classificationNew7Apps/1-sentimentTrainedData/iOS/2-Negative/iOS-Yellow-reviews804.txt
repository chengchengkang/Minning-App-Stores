Very poor results
I just tried to find a listing for Wegman's grocery stores in Mechanicsburg, PA. No results. The store has existed for 5+ years in the same location. Proves their database is grossly out of date. This frequently happens where there will be no listing or the listing is out of date. As bad as Apple Maps! You're better off just using the Google App. Erasing YP from my phone.
