Problems on second account
I love twitter and I made two accounts just because of it but the problem is I can post on my main account but not on my second. When I try to post on my second I get "We're sorry, we weren't able to send your Tweet. Would you like to retry or save this tweet in drafts?  I push retry and I still can not post. Pushing "Go to drafts" and then trying to post it again from there still does not work
