Great and all, but...
For some reason, when I tag something in the comments of one of my posts, it doesn't show up in that tag anymore. I don't know if it's supposed to be like this because it was my post or whatever because of an update, but I'm getting less likes than I have before - even though my posts are getting a lot better, and more people are complementing on my edits - so I think something's up. I know for a fact that my posts used to show up in the tags; I've been on vine for quite some time, after all. And yes, I'm using the right tags. I use the same tags pretty much all the time. Because of this problem, my posts aren't "getting out there," and I'm not gaining any followers or notoriety. I hate to sound selfish or be the type of person that thinks follower count matters; I just work really hard on my edits, and I'd like for people to actually see them, since that's the whole point of making them. If anyone thinks they can help me or explain exactly what is happening (like, I'm just getting myself worked up, something is wrong with my account, etc.), please look up: Just Call Me Sam 

Thanks.
