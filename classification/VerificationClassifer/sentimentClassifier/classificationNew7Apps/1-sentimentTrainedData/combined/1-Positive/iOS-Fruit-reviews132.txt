Great but some suggestions..
I love Fruit Ninja, but I miss the old blades you added before, such as the Soap Blade, Ben Franklin Blade, Comet Blade, Northern Lights Blade, etc. Please bring back those cool blades and let us advance beyond level 30. It's pretty boring after a while being stuck on level 30. Besides this, love the game!
