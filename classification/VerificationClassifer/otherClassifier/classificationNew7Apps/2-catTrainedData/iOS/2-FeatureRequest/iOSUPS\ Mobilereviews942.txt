Working perfectly for me!
I just downloaded this yesterday on my 3G, & it's working with no problem. I can see the entire history of a shipment.  I compared the shipment updates on the full website, & this app is exactly in sync.  No crashing, no errors.  Nicely done!   
     Suggestion:  I would love to be able to request email notifications of current status, exceptions, & delivery, here in the app, as the full website allows.
