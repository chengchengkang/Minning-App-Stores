An Almost-Welcome Reboot
Fruit Ninja was once my favorite iOS game. I loved all three modes and unlocking the different blades and backgrounds. However, after a while, it became too busy with the new updates.

Halfbrick has managed to freshen it up while maintaining the integrity of the game. Of course, I miss unlocking things like I used to. But overall, I think this game is today worth a solid four stars.

My biggest problem is the lack of multiplayer. For me, multiplayer was the killer feature of Fruit Ninja and is what brought me back time and time again. If the guys over at Halfbrick would like to make this game relevant again, I strongly suggest listening to the fans: bring back multiplayer!
