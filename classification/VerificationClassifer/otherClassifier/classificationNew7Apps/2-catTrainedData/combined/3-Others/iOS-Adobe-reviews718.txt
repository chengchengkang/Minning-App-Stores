Photoshop to go. Love it.
I regularly use adobe on my laptop, so when I saw this app I was anxious to give it a go. It is diverse, easy to use and so far, bug free. It quickly transforms and enhances your mobile photos, utilizing a variety of effects from simple to fantastical.  I like that it leaves the original image, so that I can use it for other edits. It allows you save the edit, email it, share it and save it in your adobe revel. Highly recommended.
