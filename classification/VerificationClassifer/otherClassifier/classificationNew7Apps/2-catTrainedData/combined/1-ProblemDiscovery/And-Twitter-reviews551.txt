1 Complaint Overall good app but 1 major issue for me is that when I'm scrolling through older tweets to catch up on ones I missed, the app will auto scroll to the latest tweet forcing me to have to scroll back to find where I left off. It only seems to happen if I actually click on a tweet. Very frustrating.
