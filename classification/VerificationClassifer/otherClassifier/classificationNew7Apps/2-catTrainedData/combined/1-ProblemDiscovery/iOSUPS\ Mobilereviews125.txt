Terrible version. I miss the old app
This new version does not allow you to easily interact between the tracking function and the My Choice features. The old version as more intuitive and recognized your address across both the tracking and My Choice upgrade platforms. I cannot use this app like I want. Deliveries do not get routed as requested and data is not cleared or updated. In my feed current package data is incorrect and outdated. I've called UPS and spoken to staff at UPS stores. Nobody seems to know who is responsible for the app functionality. How do I get the old app back?
