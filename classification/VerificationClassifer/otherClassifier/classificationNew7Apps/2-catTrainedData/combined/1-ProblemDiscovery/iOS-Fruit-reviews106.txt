I wish the bugs would be fixed
I have played fruit ninja for a while. But in the last mouth or so I have noticed that even when I complate a mission it will not register that I have done it like slice a fruit star in a fruit combo or slice a pomegranate 25 times  and I have done both of these and then there's slice a combo after time is up in zen mode and I have done that twitch and it still says I have to do it . And it seems some missions have come back after I did them and I make sure both of my devices are on the same page.
