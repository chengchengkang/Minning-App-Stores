Too fun!
Too fun! Starbucks has me hooked.   I love paying with my phone and watching the stars drop into my cup.   I also am pleased that my rewards can be used at teavana.  I often will get an ounce of tea with my rewards.   I'm not a coffee drinker but their specialty drinks are fantastic.   I also like their green tea and chai tea.   I think they've done a fantastic job with this app.  I've used it to locate Starbucks as well and have never had a problem.   I also enjoy the coupons loaded directly onto card.  Full Review
