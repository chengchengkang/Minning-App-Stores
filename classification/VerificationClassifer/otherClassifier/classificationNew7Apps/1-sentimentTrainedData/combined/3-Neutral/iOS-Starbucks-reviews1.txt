Missing simple features that unnecessarily waste time
Better to have this app than not have it, but I can't comprehend WHY I need to leave the app to enter Star Codes via their website?  Additionally, I can ONLY enter TWO Star Codes per day???  So basically, Starbucks penalizes us for buying more than two bags of their coffee from the grocery store.  (I've got eight Star Codes to enter, so I get the pleasure of visiting SB's website throughout the entire week).  Obscene.
