Good app but needs small things
Let me start off by saying I LOVE using this app. It just works and works well. But there are some little things that really irk me about it too. For the love of god let me stay signed in. I don't want to sign in every time I open the app just to reduce noise (which is my most used feature btw, nice work!). Just put in a remember me check box and I'll be happy. Also PLEASE update for 6/6+, you are a top tier company and some of your other apps are updated, please just do it. It improves the experience so much.
