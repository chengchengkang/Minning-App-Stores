Looking good!
Overall app works great. Starbucks should use the app to unlock bathrooms in high traffic stores; specially in cities where there might be issues with non-patrons using restrooms. Something like you make a purchase via app and the app unlocks the restroom if you need it within the next hour or two. ;)
