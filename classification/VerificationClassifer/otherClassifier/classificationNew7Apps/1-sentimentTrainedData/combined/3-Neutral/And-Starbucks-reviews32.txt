Samsung Galaxy Note 3
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 I love the convenience of the app, but for the last month, I've only been able to access the barcode on the app. When I hit done, it pops right back up . I have to hit done about 5 times when trying to reload my card bc the barcode pops back up every 2 seconds. I use this every day...please fix or advise me on what I can do to fix it. I've tried uninstalling and I stalling again, but it didn't work.  Full Review
