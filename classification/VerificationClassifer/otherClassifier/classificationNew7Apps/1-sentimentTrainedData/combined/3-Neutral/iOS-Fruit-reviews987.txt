You just managed to make the game impossible for colorblind people to play
I used to love this game, it was the first game I ever got with my iPhone 4.  The cane has become more and more complex though, not much to my liking.  All of this I was okay with though and I got used to it.  

However you have changed the color of the fruits and now the game is impossible for colorblind people to play!!!  Why on gods green earth did you make half the fruit the same color as the bombs!!!!

How can such a major game company like half brick not user test these games and realize you just made the game unplayable for people with colorblindness.  An estimated 5-6% of ALL males are colorblind and you basically just made the game unplayable for us - thanks.  

If you want to redesign the game and make it more dynamic- fine.  But you need to get a better UX designer OR offer a "classic mode".
