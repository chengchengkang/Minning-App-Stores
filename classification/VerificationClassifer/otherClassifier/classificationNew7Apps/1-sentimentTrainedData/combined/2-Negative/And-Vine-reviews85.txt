Worst... update... ever... Limited refreshing options to check to see who is following me and profile names are bunching up as I scroll down rapidly. Never had this problem on my Vine Apple app on my iPad. Never knew this app update make me want to switch to Apple iPhone... Android has disappointed me, again.
