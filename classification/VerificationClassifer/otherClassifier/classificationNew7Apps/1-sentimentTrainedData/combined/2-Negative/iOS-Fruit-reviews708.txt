Frustrating.
This so called "game" (i.e. Torture app) was insufficient to my personal likings. Maybe its because my girlfriend showed me up by 200 points in arcade mode and I'm just a sourpuss, but I hate this game because one as intelligent as myself cant seem to grasp the simple concept of slicing fruit. I even cook and I have a hard time playing this game.
