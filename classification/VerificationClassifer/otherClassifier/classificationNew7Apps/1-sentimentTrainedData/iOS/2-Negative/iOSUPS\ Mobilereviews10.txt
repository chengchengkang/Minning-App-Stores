Glitchy- JUST USE US POSTAL SERVICE!!!!!
Auto refresh makes you do everything again. If you let it go for few more seconds that you supposed to. They want to charge you for certain things...
I tried to put another address for delivery and giving me an error no explanation...üòê

I don't understand this company. And why we keep using then we better use than the one that is ours usps 
UPS is always in disadvantage because they cannot leave it in the mailbox.  It's really such a hassle to get your package... 
They like to leave a little note on your door..  And there you go, when you come home you don't have your stuff another day passed.

They charge you for pick up...
USPS they won't. Charge you

Expensive service. Unless you have a company...
I hear every word that they treat employees like sh*****t

Not a good company
