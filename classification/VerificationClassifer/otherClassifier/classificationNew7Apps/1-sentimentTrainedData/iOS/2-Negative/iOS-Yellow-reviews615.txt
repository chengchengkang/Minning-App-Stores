Worthless app
Numbers wrong. Addresses wrong. YP does not stay up to date as fast as they need to. 
In Chandler, AZ was looking for Village Inn Restaurant and when we got to the address it was a BBQ place. Tried phone number and some kind of emergency service answered. 
A lot of the phone numbers go to fax machines. 
Don't waste your time with this app.
