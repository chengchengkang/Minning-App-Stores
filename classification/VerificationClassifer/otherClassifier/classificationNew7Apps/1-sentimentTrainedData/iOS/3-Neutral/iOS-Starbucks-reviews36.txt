Please for the love of god add a $5 load option
I really love this app, however I do find I am always on the boarder of not having enough money to complete my order. I get a mocha and a bagel and have $3 left, so the next time I go to order I have to load $10? It's a endless cycle of spending a little more than I'd like on coffee. I am sure that was the corporations plan but Come on Starbucks! Let's add a $5 option for those of us in-between pay checks who still need the caffeine to kick start the day.
