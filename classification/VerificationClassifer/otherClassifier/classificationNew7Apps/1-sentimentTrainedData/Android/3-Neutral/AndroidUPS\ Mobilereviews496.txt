The app socks Because I can't be at home waiting for delivery. I tried to add the address of the office building where I live, it says it's a commercial address and isn't allow me. However I put that same address in the package to be deliver, the driver said, could not deliver didn't find address. Also I moved from another state to other and it doesn't allow to just go and delete old address from the file.
