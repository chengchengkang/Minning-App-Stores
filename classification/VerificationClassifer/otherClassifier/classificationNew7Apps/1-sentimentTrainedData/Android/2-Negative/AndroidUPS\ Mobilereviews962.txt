Try Play Store App "Deliveries" USELESS!! I have 2 shipments due next week and neither show up in this app. If package tracking is a feature, it either doesn't work or it only notifies on the day of delivery. I'll wait until Monday. If there's no change, I'll uninstall........It's MONDAY and the app shows I have nothing scheduled today, when in reality I do. Uninstalling!!
