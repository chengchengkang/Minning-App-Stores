Very fast and good line sensitivity I would say this is my second favorite drawing app for android.  It's very responsive and the canvas rotation is quite snappy.  When it comes to quick sketches this drawing app is actually my favorite, but when I want to really detail things I run into problems with the layers.  (It would be nice if you could undo layer merging.) But the selection tool is great, and this new version allows you to record your drawing which is really fun!  Overall this is a must for tablet sketchers everywhere.
