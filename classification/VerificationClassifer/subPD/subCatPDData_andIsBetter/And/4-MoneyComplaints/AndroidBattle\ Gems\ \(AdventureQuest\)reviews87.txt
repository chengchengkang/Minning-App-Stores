I like this game, but it can get really boring fast. I mean battling the same stage 15 to 20 times before you can proceed becomes repetitive. And most of the stage are like that. By the way the only way you can upgrade the level of your character is by buying stuff. Thats about it. You can learn skills along the way (by defeating a boss 15 to 20 times).
