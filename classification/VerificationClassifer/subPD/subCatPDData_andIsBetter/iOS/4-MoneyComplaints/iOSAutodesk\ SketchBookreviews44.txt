Missing content On the 10th when I tried to use sketchbook there were missing features. Not only were the pro tools AND the default tools removed, but the layers option is gone too. Why? That was the best part! It made using this app simplistic and easy to understand. Without the layers, I can't continue to make drawings. What? Am I supposed to BUY them back!? Well I spent the last of my internet cash on the last update ya palookas!
