Palm rejection doesn't. Pen pairing is sloppy Good intentions, poor execution. Newest hardware available and it can't draw a line to keep up with Pencil. Tested poorly on phone and pad. Palm rejection simply does not work with any settings. Lots of crashes.
Good work from a company that cares about quality.
