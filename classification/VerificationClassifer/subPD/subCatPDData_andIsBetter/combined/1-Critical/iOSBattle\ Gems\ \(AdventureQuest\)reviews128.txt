Love AE games Love the game now that I can play on my iPod 4th gen, but still crashes every few quests, also experiencing an annoying bug where when it crashes ill go from having 10 energy or so to -5 and ill have to wait for it to regenerate when I never got to use the other 9 or so energy, strangely only happens when I play online, offline I didn't realize progress isn't saved between the two so I played offline and when I got online again my character was way back to the beginning where I last played online so I technically have two characters now, little annoying. Minus those bugs it's amazing to play.
