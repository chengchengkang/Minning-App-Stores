BUGS AND CRASHING! I'm getting really frustrated with this app. Artix Entertainment is doing an excellent job with all of their other games I've played all of them on and off. You need to fix all of the nasty bugs, before the most recent update I couldn't turn in a quest, but could continue playing. NOW IT CRASHES CONSTANTLY! I love Artix Entertainment and I am a Founder. PLEASE FIX ALL BUGS!
