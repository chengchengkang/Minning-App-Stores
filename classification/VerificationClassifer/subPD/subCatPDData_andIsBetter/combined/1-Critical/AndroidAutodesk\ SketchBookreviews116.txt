If only the market have other competitor,I wouldn't use this apps. Most of the simple and basic function is not here, like flipping image, customize tools lay out, display the bush size when using eraser, organize picture in actual folder ....etc. All in all this is only good because no one competed with this app this in android market.  No meaningful update after I purchase from half year ago,  and encounter many crashing recently. I will not consider this developer anywhere responsible or competent.  My final word is, if you a looking to use android device as draw pad, my advice is to use other system. Since android market does not provide any good apps for the task.
