Seriously???? Seriously.. how many passwords do I have to input just to get into my own account?? Not only did I have to have two passwords before, now I have to start generating one time use passcodes as well?? HSBC is doing way too much. Technology is supposed to make your life easier, not harder. Guess no one at HSBC got that memo. If someone is willing to go thru the trouble of hacking my numerous passwords and codes, then they deserve $8.63 I have in my checking account. Heck, I'll just give them the money. This is reason enough for me to close this account and keep using Chase as my primary bank.
