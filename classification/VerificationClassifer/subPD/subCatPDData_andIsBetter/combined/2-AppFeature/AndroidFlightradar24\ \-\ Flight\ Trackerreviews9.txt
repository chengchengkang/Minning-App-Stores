Very good app Upgraded version. Good information. However sometimes a plane that you can see, does not show. The other issue is in top down view and 3d view, progress of planes jerks backwards and sometimes forwards. Update frequency is set to the lowest at 8 seconds. Otherwise, it's very good - 1 star away from excellent.
