I MISS MUSIC CACHE!! Complete downgrade from the original "VKontakte 2" app simply because the feature to cache the songs you've listened to is taken away! Hate this fact! I have a 2gb per month contract and in order to stay in my contract plus be able to listen to music every day was with the help of caching songs on the old app! I'm VERY UPSET that this feature is gone! That feature was the only/main reason I got my all my friends to make a vk account and download the app! Now I'm debating whether or not to sell my old phone because it still has the old app on it.
