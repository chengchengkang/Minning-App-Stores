Fix the update! I loved this ap until I downloaded the update yesterday.  There used to be an icon on the home screen you could tap & get a drop down box for all the airlines & once selected it would take you to a drop down box of all the in air flights of that airline.  That has disappeared in my update & it is now much more tedious to find a specific flight & I haven't been able to find the drop down of all in air flights anymore    I hope they change this back.  It is no longer user friendly!
