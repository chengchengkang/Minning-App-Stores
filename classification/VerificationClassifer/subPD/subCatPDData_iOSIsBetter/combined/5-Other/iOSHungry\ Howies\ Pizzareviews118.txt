Ehhhh... Are we using the same app??

1. Forced registration before I can even view menu? Not cool

2. If you forget to add an item that's included on a coupon and try to pick that coupon at checkout, it tells you there are no coupons for your order. 

3. Some items (sandwiches, for example) have partial descriptions, which can't be expanded. 

Am I able to add a tip to the receipt when the driver shows up? Hope so, since I have no cash on me. 

Needs some work
