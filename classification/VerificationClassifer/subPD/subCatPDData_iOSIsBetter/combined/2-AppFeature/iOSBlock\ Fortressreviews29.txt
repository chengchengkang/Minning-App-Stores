SAVE MY PROGRESS!!! This is my favorite game and all always be my favorite game! It's so much fun and I think it's a FANTASTIC game. I've had all my progress saved on iCloud which made me really happy. The new update is awesome! I love what you guys did to Block Fortress. My only problem: iCloud does not work!!! All of the progress I made in this game (Level 29) does NOT back up! PLEEEEEAAASSSEEEE fix this! I do NOT want to lose my progress and start all over. Please fix this! This is an awesome game and I want to continue to play it. Please fix this!
