Lots of bugs Just moved to an Android phone and this app skips days, has problems when you miss a day (I travel quite a bit and sometimes am forced to skip and double up a following day) by omitting certain workouts, and you also don't have the ability to modify workouts. The ios version if this app is great and I never had a single problem. The Android version has a long road to catch up.
