Bad selection The shows I like aren't even apart of this app. Where is barefoot Contessa? Emeril? They were there a few months ago then they disappeared now there is just a bunch of shows with nothing to do with cooking; like chopped, cutthroat kitchen, and some grocery store game, boooo. I will delete this app.
