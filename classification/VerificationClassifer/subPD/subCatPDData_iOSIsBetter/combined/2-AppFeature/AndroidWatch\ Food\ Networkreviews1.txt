Buggy I was so excited about this app. I was even patient with the frustration of watching commercials all over again every time I jump around to try and find where I left off. Then it quit playback 7 times in a row after finally finding my spot again and re-watching 20 something commercials in the process. Booooooo! Please fix since this app is useless until then. Also I can only find my installed app in the app store. It's not in my installed app list and it doesn't come up if I search for it.
