New problem I've been using this app for quite awhile and love it. Lately, however, the video and sound don't sync. There is a 10-12 second difference and I end up not finishing the episodes. I don't believe it's my cable company because there is not a problem on similar apps. I've tried reinstalling the app and restarting my device.
