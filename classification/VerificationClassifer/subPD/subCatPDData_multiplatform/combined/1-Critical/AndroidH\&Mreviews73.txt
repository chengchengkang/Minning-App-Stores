Great store, sorry app I absolutely LOVE H&M, but this app is constantly giving me grief. Either it crashes, won't load when I click on things, or takes pictures from items and shows them on other items (example: I'll be looking at children's clothes, but it will show me pictures of their housewares until I click on the item, then the correct picture comes up). It is VERY frustrating.
