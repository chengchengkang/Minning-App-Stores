Garbage. I found original online and it updated yesterday and removed every painting I've done! I had to master reset my phone and not only was sketchbook mobile not included in the stock apps but I lost my good sketchbook paid app. This app is trash next to the old one. It even looks generic. What drugs are you all on that would make you completely replace a wonderful app instead of adding this as a new one? Dumbest move in the history of dumb moves! I hope I can find the original online.
