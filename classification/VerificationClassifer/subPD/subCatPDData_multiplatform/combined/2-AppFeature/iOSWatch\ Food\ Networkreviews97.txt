This needs to be fixed... Hi, I'm a girl who loves food network. My dad signed in to DirectTv so I could watch all the episodes. The app worked decently. For some reason, the app just required me to sign back in and when I attempt to, it says the password/email is incorrect. I have checked it many times. Also, the commercials are really annoying and take forever to load. Maybe you could make it only 2/3 commercial breaks instead of 6/7. This app needs fixing, but a great start.
