Strange bug! Anytime I view items on this app, it saves all the images to my gallery, even colour swatch circles. I've lost count of how many times I've have to delete an album with 1,000 plus images in it. I like H&M but I don't want my online accounts filled with catalogue images! Time to uninstall, please sort this out as the app is pleasant to use.
