Better for iPad than iPhone In the past decade I have dealt with HSBC and their garbage, this is the worst app they could possibly make. The balances are incorrect and I had to call customer service, an excruciating ordeal, to get them to add accounts. Imagine my surprise when I log in to see a $480 debit made when I hadn't even used the card. I check with the iPad and it says credit pending. The only reason this gets any stars is because the iPad format gives details and correct information.
