Basically a failure! Got my confirmation and it had my home address after I'd just gone through a huge process of adding the address I'd wished the food to be delivered to. The confirmation email mentioned to call the store with further assistance or questions. So I tried... and tried and tried!!! Then... they were "closed" WORST PART IS THAT MY SISTER WAS AT MY HOME ADDRESS AND MY ORDER NEVER CAME ANYWAYS!! #Pissed #Dominos
