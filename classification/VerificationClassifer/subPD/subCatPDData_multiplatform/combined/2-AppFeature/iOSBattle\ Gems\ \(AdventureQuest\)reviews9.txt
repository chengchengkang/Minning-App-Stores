I love it This is the first time I've made an actual review and it may seem pretty late but I guess I've always pushed it out of my mind and continued playing both AQ and Battle Gems. I really really really really love it. But I've encountered this sorta difficulty, I have all 3 keys to go on and play the level but for some reason, I can't play. I've been waiting for a long time for each key to appear. Is it because I accidentally deleted the game and had to reinstall it?
