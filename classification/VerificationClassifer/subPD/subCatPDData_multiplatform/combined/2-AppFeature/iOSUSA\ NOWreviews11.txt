Absolutely terrible The major downfall of this app is the inability to store your username and password for your cable provider. I have many apps for television and this is the only one that is this bad.
Unable to watch more than one episode in a "session" without having to force quit and re-login. So annoying that it makes it pretty unusable.
If you close the all to do anything, same thing! You have to log back in with the 3 step process. Geez please fix this!
