One Issue... Love the app because I love the TV channel. Only issue I have is that when watching live tv and I AirPlay the show to my Apple TV I constantly have to keep the phone screen from fading out because if it shuts off the show stops too; need a quick update so that if the phone screen turns off the live TV will continue on the TV screen!
