Worse than Useless What a really rubbish app. My Panasonic Viera is less than 5 months old and this Panasonic App can't see it on my house network... And worse than that. It doesn't even give you an option to manually enter the IP address it's too stupid to find for itself. Anyone planing on buying a Panasonic TV... Don't if you plan on using this app.
