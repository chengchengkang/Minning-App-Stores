Junk App. It should be no star for HSBC app! It is a really junk app! 
I downloaded this app for my iPad. It is unbelievable! I cannot go through the first step of the app! It keeps asking "please enter a valid Internet banking ID". After I entered my username ID, it keep saying "please try again". I try again and again. It still keep saying the same things. Finally, I deleted the app...!
