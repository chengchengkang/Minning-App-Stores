Won't stream to Apple TV App works fine, just won't stream video to AppleTV which renders it largely useless in my opinion.  Curiously, it will still stream sound to the TV.  It would be one thing if you were trying to watch on the big screen without a cable provider, but there's no excuse for not being able to stream to TV with a cable provider login.

The overall star rating of this app is far too high considering the limited functionality mentioned above. Read the other comments closely; you'll notice that the language is suspiciously similar in many. Clearly someone is seeding the reviews with positive commentary.
