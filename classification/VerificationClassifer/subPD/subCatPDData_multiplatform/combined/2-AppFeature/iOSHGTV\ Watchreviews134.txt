Constantly Freezes! This app freezes up at every commercial break. Then I have to close the show I'm watching, reopen it, slide the time tracker to just beyond the commercial, endure another set of commercials that freezes, close the show again, and finally reopen it.  This is the ONLY way I can it to play again.  It's really frustrating because the shows themselves stream beautifully - it's just the commercials that freeze everything up and make the app useless.  I've tried updating it and also uninstalling and reinstalling it.  Nothing helps.
