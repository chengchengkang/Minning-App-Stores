Mous issue Well... it worked like a charm on my htc rezound for a while but the mouse stopped working one day. For some reason you cannot move the mouse around at all which made the app useless.  I got a samsung gs3 and was praying it too would not have the same issue but boy was i wrong. I wonder if they will ever fix our problems...
