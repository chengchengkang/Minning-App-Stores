Truly dreadful This app is not designed for ux. the main problems are - a) very slow, b) requires numerous passwords and steps to login, c) transactions are not easy to view - requires you to click each one to see details.
Just look at any other bank and copy.
Deserves the Oscar for the worst app ever.
