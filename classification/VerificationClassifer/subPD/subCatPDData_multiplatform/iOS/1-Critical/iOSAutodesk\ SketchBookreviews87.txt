Still crashes when using "typing" feature This was a problem with the original sketchbook pro app, after one of the major iOS software upgrades, and after a long time, it was fixed. Can't use this new app, until typing works, for my cartoons. Keep at it! In meantime, old app is working great, thank heavens. 

Thank you.
