Great game but something's messed up I don't know if this is because I signed in to Facebook but it keeps changing my energy to negatives and it wouldn't give me keys, it would just keep counting but never actually gave me any, and on the main page it isn't my character it's the default one, it'd be great if they could get on to fixing that
