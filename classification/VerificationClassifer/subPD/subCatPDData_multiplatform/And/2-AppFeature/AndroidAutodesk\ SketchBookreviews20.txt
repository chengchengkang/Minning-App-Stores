I love it but uh I love it and I have been using it for about a year or so and I have to say my art skills have improved and I was thrilled to see that the record option was added but the app freezes and I have to shut it down witch makes me loose the recording also when I want to save the recording it goes to my downloads instead of my camera roll like on apple edition
