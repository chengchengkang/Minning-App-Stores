Ongoing problems with login This is one of the most frustrating banking apps I have used due to how hard it is to log in. It usually takes 3 attempts at log in before I can access the app. If you're looking at this app before deciding to bank with HSBC I would say don't do it. Find another bank that has their mobile banking sorted!
