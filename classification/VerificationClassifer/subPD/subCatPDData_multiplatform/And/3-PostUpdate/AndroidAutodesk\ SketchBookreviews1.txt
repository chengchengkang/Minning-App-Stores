CRAP Customer Service Removed another star, I did like this app but unfortunately I find the user interface frustrating and interuptive to my drawing style (compared to the other pro apps l use) a colour fill tool and a save progress button feature would improve workflow rather than the save and exit protocol. UPDATE the Pro trial autodesk kept offering doesn't initiate and the app will no longer support formats that it previously imported, gradually running out of stars! Would never subscribe to an unstable app.
