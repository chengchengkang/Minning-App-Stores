Was good, but needs fixing! Waited for some weeks before updating this review. The last update to this app made it near-unusable on my Galaxy Note 4. Any but the slowest, tightest strokes lag behind the stylus so bad that it's nearly impossible for me to draw. This needs to be fixed, it's completely useless to me as it is now.
