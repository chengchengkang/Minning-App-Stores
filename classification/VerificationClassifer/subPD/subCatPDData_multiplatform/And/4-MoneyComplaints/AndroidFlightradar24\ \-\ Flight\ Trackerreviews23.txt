Did you say a flight could be teacked? I specifically bought the full version of the app the night before my son travelled to Los Angeles. As you've probably guessed, the idea was to track his flight. Dropped him off at Heathrow, and on return home, tried to track the flight and all I could get after putting the flight number in is the aircraft, the scheduled departure time, scheduled arrival time. Status: unknown. What a disappointment, had I bought the app in a local shop, I would have taken it straight back. What a load of rubbish.
